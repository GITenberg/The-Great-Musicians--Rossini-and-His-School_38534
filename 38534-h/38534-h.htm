<h1>ROSSINI AND HIS SCHOOL.</h1>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.<br /><br />
<small>ROSSINI'S CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.</small></h2>

<p>A <small>CONTEMPORARY</small> of Cimarosa and of Paisiello, his
predecessors, but not, except at the very outset of his
career, his models, and of Donizetti, Bellini, and Verdi,
his successors, and in an artistic sense his followers,
Rossini is a central figure in the nineteenth-century
history of Italian music.</p>

<p>Lives of Rossini have been published freely enough
during the last fifty or sixty years. It but rarely happens,
even to the greatest man, to have his biography written
or his statue erected during his lifetime. But Rossini
lived so long that it seemed impossible to wait for his
death; and more than one writer seized upon him when
he was still a young man. Perhaps it occurred to the
Abbé Carpani, the first of Rossini's biographers, that<a name="page_002" id="page_002"></a>
he was already approaching the critical age at which
so many great composers&mdash;not to speak of painters and
poets&mdash;had ceased not only to work but to live;
Mozart, for instance, Cimarosa, Weber, Hérold, Bellini,
Schubert, and Mendelssohn. It has been suggested,
indeed, that Rossini might perhaps have wished his
career to be measured against those of so many other
composers whose days were cut short at about the age he
had attained when he produced <i>William Tell</i>. Rossini
was but thirty-seven when <i>William Tell</i>, his last work
for the stage, and his last work of any importance with
the exception of the <i>Stabat Mater</i> was brought out.
But when, soon after the production of <i>Semiramide</i>,
played for the first time in 1823, Stendhal published
that <i>Life of Rossini</i> which is known to be founded almost
entirely on the Abbé Carpani's work, Rossini, at the
age of thirty-one, had already completed the most important
portion of his artistic life. Readable, interesting,
and in many places charming, Stendhal's <i>Life of
Rossini</i> is at the same time meagre, and, worse still,
untrustworthy. But there is no reason why a tolerable
Life of Rossini, including an account of all the changes
and reforms introduced by this composer into Italian
opera, should not have been published when he was
only thirty-one years of age. There would have been
nothing of moment to add to it but a narrative of
Rossini's visit to London, of his residence in Paris, and
above all, of the circumstances under which he produced
<i>William Tell</i> together with his reasons&mdash;if they could
only be discovered&mdash;for abandoning composition when
he had once produced that work.<a name="page_003" id="page_003"></a></p>

<p>The life of Rossini divides itself, more naturally than
most things to which this favourite mode of division
is applied, into three parts. During the first period
of his existence, extending from his birth to the year
1823 when <i>Semiramide</i> was brought out, he made his
reputation. From 1823 when he visited London and
Paris, until 1829 when he produced his great masterpiece
in the serious style, and afterwards threw down his pen
for ever, he made his fortune. Finally, from 1829, the
year of <i>William Tell</i>, until 1869, the year of his death,
he enjoyed his fortune and his reputation; caring not
too much for either, and so little desirous to increase
the former that he abandoned his "author's rights"
in France&mdash;fees, that is to say, which he was entitled
to receive for the representation of his works&mdash;to
the Society of Musical Composers.</p>

<p>Rossini made his appearance in public when he was
only seven years of age; doing so not, it need scarcely
be said, in the character of a composer, but in that of a
singer. It was in Paer's <i>Camilla</i>, composed for Vienna
and afterwards brought out at Bologna, that Rossini, in
the year 1799, took the part of a child. "Nothing,"
says Madame Giorgi-Righetti, the original Rosina in
the <i>Barber of Seville</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> "could be more tender, more
touching, than the voice and action of this extraordinary
child in the beautiful canon of the third act;
<i>senti si fiero instante</i>. The Bolognese of that time
declared that he would some day be one of the greatest
musicians known. I need not say whether the prophecy
has been verified."<a name="page_004" id="page_004"></a></p>

<p>Gioachino Antonio Rossini was born on the 29th
February, 1792; and the circumstance of his having
come into the world in a leap-year justified him, he used
to maintain, in counting his birthday, not annually
according to the usual custom, but once every four
years. According to this method of computation he had
numbered nineteen birthdays when, at the age of seventy-seven,
he died. What is better worth remembering is
the fact that Rossini was born, as if by way of compensation,
the very year in which Mozart died; Mozart
who, indebted to the Italians for much of the sweetness
and singableness of his lovely melodies, was to give to
Italy, through Rossini, new instrumental combinations,
new dramatic methods, and new operatic forms.</p>

<p>It may have been very desirable to show that Rossini
was of distinguished ancestry, and that he had a great-uncle,
who, in the middle of the sixteenth century, was
governor of Ravenna. But it is more interesting to know
that he was of good musical parentage. His father, it
is true, was nothing more than town trumpeter at
Pesaro; herald and crier, that is to say, to the sound of
the trumpet. But his mother was what musicians call
"an artist." She possessed a very beautiful voice; and
when the town trumpeter fell ill or in some other
manner incapacitated himself for supporting the
family, she replaced him as bread-winner by taking an
engagement as an operatic singer. According to one of
Rossini's biographers, Rossini the trumpeter came to
grief through his political opinions, which were of a
more decided character than any that were ever professed,
publicly at least, by his eminent son. When,<a name="page_005" id="page_005"></a>
after the Italian campaign, the French army in 1796
entered Pesaro, the old Rossini so far forgot his official
position and the duty he owed to the state, as to
proclaim his sympathy and admiration for the Republican
troops; on whose retirement he was punished
for his want of loyalty, being first deprived of his
employment and afterwards cast into prison.</p>

<p>The trumpet was not the only instrument cultivated
by the elder Rossini. He also played the horn; playing
it, not like an ordinary town crier, from whom only
a few loud flourishes would be expected by way of
preliminary announcement, but in true musicianly style.</p>

<p>The horn, eighty years ago, was not a very important
instrument in Italian orchestration. But such as it was
the elder Rossini played it in more than one operatic
band; and in due time, and to all appearances as soon
as it was physically possible to do so, the father taught
the art of playing the horn to his precocious son.
Rossini was still very young when he accompanied his
parents on musical excursions, or "tours" as they would
now be called; and on these occasions, when the father
took the part of first horn in some local orchestra&mdash;which
was sometimes nothing more than the band of a
travelling show&mdash;the part of second horn was assigned
to the son. The mother at the same time sang on
the stage. Rossini, then, at once vocalist and instrumentalist,
began his career in both characters at a very
early age. It has been seen that at seven he appeared
on the stage as an operatic singer. Between the ages of
seven and twelve he was much occupied in horn playing;
and his performances in company with his father had<a name="page_006" id="page_006"></a>
probably some effect in developing that taste for wind
instruments and especially for horns, for which his
orchestration was one day to be remarkable.</p>

<p>In his thirteenth year Rossini was taken to Bologna
and presented to Professor Tesci of that city. The
professor heard the little boy sing and play, and was so
pleased with his performances that he procured him
an engagement as chorister in one of the local churches.
It was of this period in Rossini's life that Heine was
thinking when, in his well-known article on Rossini's
<i>Stabat Mater</i>, he wrote: "The true character of Christian
art does not reside in thinness and plainness of the body,
but in a certain effervescence of the soul which neither
the musician nor the painter can appropriate to himself
either by baptism or by study; and in this respect I
find in the <i>Stabat</i> of Rossini a more truly Christian
character than in the <i>Paulus</i> of Felix Mendelssohn
Bartholdy; an oratorio which the adversaries of Rossini
point to as a model of the Christian style. Heaven
preserve me from wishing to express by that the least
blame against a master so full of merits as the composer
of <i>Paulus</i>; and the author of these letters is less
likely than any one to wish to criticise the Christian
character of the oratorio in question from clerical, or,
so to say, pharisaical reasons. I cannot, however,
avoid pointing out that at the age when Mendelssohn
commenced Christianity at Berlin (he was only baptized
in his thirteenth year), Rossini had already deserted it
a little, and had lost himself entirely in the mundane
music of operas. Now he has again abandoned the
latter to carry himself back in dreams to the Catholic<a name="page_007" id="page_007"></a>
recollections of his first youth&mdash;to the days when he
sang as a child in the choir of the Pesaro [for which read
Bologna] cathedral, and took part as an acolyte in the
service of the holy mass."</p>

<p>Besides enabling him to earn money by singing in the
churches, Professor Tesci gave his young friend lessons
in singing and pianoforte playing, so that after two
years he could execute the most difficult music at first
sight. He now was found competent to act as musical
director, and accepted an engagement in that character
with a travelling company which gave performances at
various little towns in the Romagna. When he was
fifteen years of age Rossini gave up his engagement as
director to the wandering troop and went back to
Bologna, where (1807) he was admitted as a student to
the Lyceum. Such application and such intelligence
did he now show, that after he had been but one year
at the academy he was chosen by the director, Professor
Mattei, to compose the cantata expected annually from
the Lyceum's best pupil.</p>

<p>Rossini's first work, written when he was sixteen
years of age and executed at the Lyceum of Bologna
in 1808, was the cantata in question, which, if not based
on the favourite subject of Orpheus, was at least connected
with it. <i>Pianto d'Armonia per la Morte d'Orfeo</i>
was at once the subject and the title of this memorable
composition. At this period Rossini was an ardent
student of Haydn's symphonies and quartets; and
after the production of his cantata, which obtained
remarkable success, he was appointed director of the
Philharmonic concerts, and profited by his position to<a name="page_008" id="page_008"></a>
give a performance of Haydn's <i>Seasons</i>. A distinct
reminiscence of this time, and more than a distinct
reminiscence of one of the best known melodies in
the <i>Seasons</i>, was to be found eight years afterwards in
the lively trio ("Zitti, Zitti") of <i>The Barber of Seville</i>.</p>

<p>During his studies at the Lyceum Rossini did not
neglect the piano. He entertained a high respect for
this admirable instrument, this orchestra on a reduced
scale, minus, of course, the variety of <i>timbres</i>; and one
of his latest works was a fantasia for pianoforte on airs
from <i>L'Africaine</i>, dedicated to his friend Meyerbeer.
Rossini used at this time to style himself "pianist of
the fourth class;" and that he obtained no higher rank
in the pianistic hierarchy is perhaps due to the peculiarity
of the instruction he received from his professor
at the Lyceum of Bologna, Signor Prinetti. Prinetti
taught his pupils to play the scales with the first finger
and thumb. A pianist taught to depend on his first
finger and thumb to the neglect of the three other
fingers could scarcely be expected to graduate very
highly in the pianoforte schools.</p>

<p>Rossini was just seventeen years of age when he
produced his first symphony, which was followed by a
quartet; and a year later he brought out his first opera.
During his musical travels in the Romagna, where, among
other places, he was in the habit of visiting Lugo,
Ferrara, Forli, and Sinigaglia, he had, at the last-named
place, inspired with confidence the Marquis Cavalli,
director of the local theatre. The marquis was also
impresario of the San Mosè Theatre at Venice (the San
Mosè, like most other Italian theatres, took its name<a name="page_009" id="page_009"></a>
from the parish to which it belonged), and he wished
Rossini to compose an opera for his Venetian establishment.
Rossini's previous work had been performed
before the professor's pupils and a few invited friends
at the Lyceum of Bologna. The opera ordered by the
Marquis Cavalli was the first of his works performed
before the general public. It was a one-act piece, entitled
<i>La Cambiale di Matrimonio</i>. It was given for the
first time in 1810 when Rossini was just eighteen years
old. The sum paid for it was 200 francs, or, in English
money, 8<i>l.</i></p>

<p><i>La Cambiale di Matrimonio</i> was succeeded by a
cantata on the oft-treated subject of the abandonment
of Dido. <i>Didone Abbandonata</i> was composed for a
relative, the brilliant Esther Mombelli, and it was
performed in 1811. The same year Rossini brought
out at Bologna <i>L'Equivoco Stravagante</i>, an <i>opera buffa</i>
in two acts. In this work, of which nothing seems to
have been preserved, the concerted pieces were much
admired. The final rondo, too, is still cited as a type
of those final airs for which Rossini seemed to have a
particular taste until, after producing the most brilliant
specimen of the style in the "Non più mesta" of
<i>Cinderella</i>, he left them to the care of other less
original composers; for of Rossini's final airs "Non
più mesta" was the final one of all.</p>

<p>None of Rossini's earlier operas were engraved; a
circumstance which allowed him to borrow from them
the best pieces for other works, but which also
prevents us in the present day from arriving at any
precise idea as to their value and importance.<a name="page_010" id="page_010"></a></p>

<p>The first opera of Rossini's which, years afterwards,
was deemed worthy the honour of a revival was
<i>L'Inganno Felice</i>, composed in 1812 for Venice. It
was brought out at Paris in 1819; and the impresario,
Barbaja, for whom Rossini composed so many admirable
works, gave it at Vienna, where he was carrying on
an operatic enterprise simultaneously with two other
operatic enterprises at Milan and at Naples.</p>

<p><i>L'Inganno Felice</i> was the first opera by which Rossini
made a decided mark, and such was its success that he
was now requested to furnish works for Ferrara, Milan,
and Rome. For Ferrara he was to compose an oratorio.</p>

<p>But although <i>Ciro in Babilonia</i> is generally described
in the catalogues of Rossini's works as an oratorio, yet,
like <i>Mosè in Egitto</i> composed six years later, it was an
opera so far as regards form, and was only called an
oratorio from the circumstance of its being given in
Lent without the usual stage accessories. <i>Ciro in Babilonia</i>
was by no means successful as a whole. The
composer, however, saved from the wreck of his oratorio
two valuable fragments: a chorus which afterwards
figured in <i>Aureliano in Palmira</i>, and from which he
borrowed the theme of Almaviva's beautiful solo in
<i>The Barber of Seville</i>, "Ecco ridente il cielo;" and the
concerted finale which, in the year 1827, found its way
into the French version of <i>Mosè in Egitto</i>.</p>

<p>Some forty years after the production of <i>Ciro in
Babilonia</i> Rossini spoke to Ferdinand Hiller (who has
recorded the words in his highly interesting <i>Conversations
with Rossini</i>) of a poor woman who had only one
good note in her voice, which he accordingly made her<a name="page_011" id="page_011"></a>
repeat while the melody of the solo given to her in
<i>Ciro</i> was played by the orchestra. So in the French
burlesque of <i>Les Saltimbanques</i>, an untaught player of
the trombone is introduced, who, being able to play but
one note, is told that that will suffice, and that if he
keeps strictly to it "the lovers of that note will be
delighted."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.<br /><br />
<small>LA PIETRA DEL PARAGONE.</small></h2>

<p>R<small>OSSINI</small> had already written two operas in 1812, and
he was destined in this fertile year to produce three
more: two at Venice, <i>La Scala di Seta</i> and <i>L'Occasione
fa il Ladro</i>; and one at Milan, <i>La Pietra del Paragone</i>.</p>

<p><i>La Pietra del Paragone</i> was Rossini's next great
success after <i>L'Inganno Felice</i>. The leading parts were
assigned to Galli, afterwards one of the most famous
bass-singers of his time, and to Madame Marcolini, who
had played the principal character in <i>L'Equivoco Stravagante</i>,
and who had particularly distinguished herself
in that work by her singing of the final rondo before
mentioned.</p>

<p>In <i>La Pietra del Paragone</i> Madame Marcolini was
furnished with a final rondo of the pattern already
approved, and in this, as in the earlier one, she gained
a most brilliant success.<a name="page_012" id="page_012"></a></p>

<p>The libretto of <i>La Pietra del Paragone</i> is founded on
an idea at least as old as that of <i>Timon of Athens</i>.
Count Asdrubal, surrounded by friends and beloved by
a charming young lady, is rash enough to wish to know
whether the friendship and the love he seems to have
inspired are due to himself and his own personal
qualities, or to the riches he is known to possess. To
determine the point he causes a bill of exchange for a
large sum to be presented at his house. He himself
appears in disguise to claim the money; and, in accordance
with instructions given beforehand, the count's
steward recognises the signature and honours the draft.
The sum for which the bill has been made out is so
large that to pay it the count's exchequer is absolutely
drained. Some few of the friends stand the test well
enough, but others, as might have been expected, prove
insincere. As for the young lady, the "touchstone"
has the effect of bringing out her character in the
brightest colours. Timid by nature, she had hitherto
refrained from expressing, except in the most reserved
manner, the love she really entertains for Count
Asdrubal. After his apparent ruin, however, the
advances are all from her side; and she finds herself
obliged to resort to all kinds of devices in order to
compel him to a formal declaration. She even feels
called upon to appear&mdash;though whether for logical or
merely for picturesque reasons can scarcely at this
distant date be decided&mdash;in a Hussar uniform; and in
this striking garb Madame Marcolini sang the celebrated
final rondo, saluting the public with her sabre
in acknowledgment of their applause, and repeating<a name="page_013" id="page_013"></a>
the salutes again and again as the applause was renewed.</p>

<p><i>La Pietra del Paragone</i> is quite unknown to the
opera-goers of the present day. It belongs to the year
1812, and probably no one now living ever heard it.
Many, however, have heard portions of it; for <i>La
Pietra del Paragone</i> not having proved thoroughly
successful as a whole, the composer extracted the
best pieces from it and introduced them into <i>La
Cenerentola</i>, which, five years later, was represented for
the first time at Rome. The air "Miei rampolli," the
duet "Un soave no so chè," the drinking chorus, and the
baron's burlesque proclamation, were all borrowed or
rather taken once and for ever from the score of <i>La
Pietra del Paragone</i>. Some other pieces, too, from
the same work were nearly fifty years later heard at
least once in an opera attributed to Rossini brought
out at Paris in the year 1859. It has been said that
among Rossini's operas of the year 1812 were two
written for the San Mosè of Venice. The second of
these, <i>L'Occasione fa il Ladro</i>, made its appearance
substantially at Naples in conjunction with the pieces
just spoken of, extracted from <i>La Pietra del Paragone</i>.
An Italian poetaster, Signor Berettoni, gave to his
new arrangement of <i>L'Occasione fa il Ladro</i> (which,
by the way, he had enriched with selections not only
from <i>La Pietra del Paragone</i>, but also from <i>Aureliano
in Palmira</i>) the title of <i>Un Curioso Accidente</i>.</p>

<p>Rossini, however, though he did not mind borrowing
from himself, did not choose to be borrowed from without
permission, as without dexterity, by other persons; and<a name="page_014" id="page_014"></a>
finding that a <i>pasticcio</i> made up of pieces taken more or
less at random from the works of his youth was to be
brought out as a new and original work, he addressed
to the manager of the Théâtre des Italiens, M. Calzado,
the following letter on the subject:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">"<i>November 11th, 1859.</i>.</p>

<p>"S<small>IR</small>,&mdash;I am told that the bills of your theatre announce
a new opera by me under this title <i>Un Curioso
Accidente</i>.</p>

<p>"I do not know whether I have the right to prevent
the representation of a production in two acts (more or
less) made up of old pieces of mine; I have never occupied
myself with questions of this kind in regard to my
works (not one of which, by the way, is named <i>Un
Curioso Accidente</i>). In any case I have not objected
to, and I do not object to, the representation of <i>Un
Curioso Accidente</i>. But I cannot allow the public invited
to your theatre, and your subscribers to think
either that it is a <i>new</i> opera by me or that I took any
part in arranging it.</p>

<p>"I must beg of you then to remove from your bills
the word <i>new</i>, together with my name as author, and to
substitute instead the following:&mdash;'Opera, consisting of
pieces by M. Rossini, arranged by M. Berettoni.'</p>

<p>"I request that this alteration may appear in the
bills of to-morrow, in default of which I shall be
obliged to ask from justice what I now ask from your
good faith.</p>

<p class="r">
<span style="margin-right: 10%;">"Accept my sincere compliments,</span><br />
(Signed)           <span style="margin-left: 2em;">"G<small>IOACHINO</small> R<small>OSSINI</small>."</span></p>
</div>

<p>On receiving this letter the manager withdrew the
well-named <i>Curioso Accidente</i>, in connection with
which no accident was more curious than that of its<a name="page_015" id="page_015"></a>
production. It had already been played once; and
at this single representation much success had been
obtained by a trio in the buffo style for men's voices
borrowed from <i>La Pietra del Paragone</i>, and a duet for
soprano and contralto from <i>Aureliano in Palmira</i>.</p>

<p>It is not so easy as it may at first appear to decide
which deserves to be considered the first of Rossini's
operas. The opera or operetta of <i>La Cambiale di
Matrimonio</i> (1810), was the first produced on the
stage; and <i>L'Inganno Felice</i> (1812), was the first which
made a marked impression, and which, played throughout
Italy, at Paris, and at Vienna, gained for its author
something like a European reputation. But the first
opera that Rossini ever composed was <i>Demetrio e
Polibio</i>, which, written in the spring of 1809 when he
was just seventeen years old, was produced at Rome&mdash;though
not until it had undergone a process of
retouching&mdash;in 1812.</p>

<p>An Italian officer, whom Stendhal met at Como one
night when <i>Demetrio e Polibio</i> was to be represented&mdash;or
perhaps it was the Abbé Carpani who met him; in any
case the story is to be found in Stendhal's Life of Rossini&mdash;gave
this curious account of the Mombelli family, all
of whom were connected in one way or another with
the performance of Rossini's earliest opera.</p>

<p>"The Mombellis Company," he said, "consists of
a single family. Of the two daughters, one, who is
always dressed as a man, takes the part of the musico
(or sopranist); that is Marianna. The other one,
Esther, who has a voice of greater extent though
less even, less perfectly sweet, is the prima donna. In<a name="page_016" id="page_016"></a>
<i>Demetrio e Polibio</i> the old Mombelli, who was once a
celebrated tenor takes the part of the King. That of
the chief of the conspirators will be filled by a person
called Olivieri, who has long been attached to Madame
Mombelli, the mother, and who, to be useful to the
family, takes utility parts on the stage and acts in the
house as cook and major domo. Without being pretty,
the Mombellis have pleasing faces. But they are ferociously
virtuous, and it is supposed that the father, who
is an ambitious man, wishes to get them married."</p>

<p>Madame Mombelli, moreover, had written the libretto,
while the old Mombelli&mdash;once a "celebrated tenor" and
still "so ambitious" as to wish to see his daughters legitimately
married&mdash;had from among his plentiful reminiscences
given Rossini ideas for melodies. Not only did
the company, in the words of Stendhal's officer, consist
of a single family; this family included, moreover,
among its members, the composer himself, who was
somehow related to the Mombellis.</p>

<p>From 1812 to 1813 was for Rossini a great step in
advance; for during this latter year were produced
<i>Tancredi</i> and <i>L'Italiana in Algeri</i>, works destined
within a very short time to find their way all over
Europe. But before producing <i>Tancredi</i>, Rossini began
the year by bringing out a little operetta entitled <i>Il
Figlio per Azzardo</i>.</p>

<p>Rossini caused in his time a great deal of trouble to
managers; and if those with whom he had to deal were
for the most part bald, that, he said, was to be accounted
for by his having driven them repeatedly to tear their
<a name="page_017" id="page_017"></a>hair. Some of the directors suffered from his apparent
laziness, which at most could be called dilatoriness;
for that Rossini was a composer of extraordinary activity
is shown by the fact that by the time he was thirty-seven
he had written thirty-seven operas; while,
during the period of his greatest fertility, he frequently
produced as many as four operas in one year. More
than once, too, he completed an opera within a fortnight;
but this fortnight was usually the last and never the
first of the space of time assigned to him for the composition
of a given work. Sometimes, however, he was
annoyed and worried by managers without sufficient
cause; and in these cases he knew how to retaliate.
The manager of the San Mosè theatre, that Marquis
Cavalli who also directed the theatre of Sinigaglia,
and who, as already mentioned, had given Rossini his
first commission, thought that having begun by
writing for the San Mosè, the young composer ought
not to work for any other theatre at Venice. He had
engaged, however, to write an opera for the Fenice,
where <i>Tancredi</i> was destined to be brought out; and the
Marquis was so annoyed at this that he treated Rossini
on more than one occasion with absolute incivility.
He had supplied him, moreover, with a libretto so
monstrously absurd that it was impossible to treat it
seriously, or even in the spirit of mere comedy. Rossini,
however, had to choose between setting this
nonsense to music or paying a fine; and he preferred
the former alternative. The task he now set himself
was to compose to his ridiculous libretto music more
ridiculous even than the words. Tenor music was
given to the bass, who, to execute it, had to shout at the<a name="page_018" id="page_018"></a>
top of his voice. The soprano, on the other hand, had
been furnished with a contralto part, which made demands
only upon the lowest notes of her voice. A
singer of notorious-incompetence was provided with a
most difficult air, accompanied <i>pianissimo</i>, so that his
faults might at least not be concealed. Another singer,
whose burlesque appearance never failed to throw the
house into convulsions, had to sing a sentimental
melody of the most lackadaisical kind. The orchestration
was quite as remarkable as the writing for the
voices. One of Rossini's great merits consists in his
having introduced new instruments into the operatic
orchestra of his time; and in scoring <i>Il Figlio per
Azzardo</i>, he wrote parts for instruments of percussion
never before and probably never afterwards employed.
These were the tin-shades of the candles with which
the desks of the players were furnished, and which, in
one movement, had to be struck at the beginning of
each bar. For a time the public smiled at Rossini's
pleasantry, until at last it occurred to some one that the
composer was taking liberties with his audience. Then
hoots and hisses were heard from every part of the
theatre, and the end of Rossini's practical joke was
that the practical joker had to rush from his post at
the head of the orchestra and seek safety in flight.<a name="page_019" id="page_019"></a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.<br /><br />
<small>ITALIAN OPERA UNTIL THE TIME OF ROSSINI.</small></h2>

<p><i>Tancredi</i> was Rossini's first serious opera, and the first
opera by which his name became known throughout
Europe. In this work, too, we find indicated, if not
fully carried out, all those changes in the composition of
the lyric drama which, without absolutely inventing
them, he introduced from Germany, and especially from
Mozart's operas, into Italy.</p>

<p>It seems strange, what was nevertheless the case,
that when Rossini began to write, the mere forms of the
lyric drama were, in Italy at least, far from being looked
upon as settled. Opera could not at that time boast a
history of more than about two centuries, and though
it had made great progress during the previous hundred
years and was scarcely the same entertainment as that
which the most illustrious nobles in Italy had taken
under their protection in the early part of the seventeenth
century, it was still far from resembling the opera
of the present day; so much more developed, so much
more elaborated.</p>

<p>No general view of the progress of operatic art in
Europe can well be taken; for its advance has been
different in each country. But its progress in Italy
was sufficiently regular from its birth, or rather its
invention, towards the end of the sixteenth century up<a name="page_020" id="page_020"></a>
to the period of Scarlatti; and from Scarlatti in a
continuous line to Rossini.</p>

<p>Without going back to the origin of music in general,
it may not be inappropriate, in connection with Rossini's
innovations, and with a view to these innovations
being better understood, to sketch in the briefest manner
the history of the musical drama in Italy from its deliberate
invention until, after its various developments,
it became what Rossini made it between the years 1813,
the year in which <i>Tancredi</i> was brought out, and 1823,
the date of the production of <i>Semiramide</i>.</p>

<p>The opera, so far as a natural origin can be claimed
for it at all, proceeds from the sacred musical plays of
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, as the modern
drama proceeds from the so-called mysteries of the
same period. Indeed the earliest musical dramas of
modern Italy, from which the opera of the present day
is directly descended, were mysteries differing only
from the dramatic mysteries in having been written
for the singing, not for the speaking voice. The
opera, or drama in music, is not, compared with the
spoken drama, a very ancient form of art. Persons
afflicted with a rage for seeking in the distant past
traces and origins of a form of art which was created
and forced into existence in comparatively modern
times, see the first specimens of opera in the Greek
plays; a view which will be worth considering when
writers on the subject of Greek music have come to
an understanding as to its exact nature. One thing
is quite certain, that the Greek plays are remembered
solely by what musicians call the "words," whereas,<a name="page_021" id="page_021"></a>
with the exception of Herr Wagner's highly poetical,
highly dramatic works, there are no operas written to
be performed throughout in music, which, by their words
alone, would have the least chance of living. Nor did
the musical mysteries or musical plays of the fifteenth
century&mdash;which were partly declaimed, partly sung, and
always by solo voices&mdash;bear any great resemblance
to the grand operas of the present day with their airs,
duets, concerted pieces, and elaborate dramatic finales,
supported by an orchestra which is always being varied
and reinforced through the addition of new instruments,
and in which composers aim constantly at the formation
of new instrumental combinations. Of course, too,
the sacred musical plays of the fifteenth century differed
from our modern operas by their subjects. A primitive
sort of opera on the <i>Conversion of St. Paul</i>, which was
performed throughout in music at Rome in 1440, is not
the sort of work that would be likely to interest our
modern audiences, who entertain a marked preference
for operas in which a leading part is assigned to the
prima donna, and who have no objection to the prima
donna's representing a thoroughly mundane character,
such as the fascinating Carmen, in the late M. Bizet's
opera of that name, or the less fascinating Violetta, in
Verdi's <i>Traviata</i>.</p>

<p>The first opera on a profane, or rather on a secular
subject&mdash;for it is surely a mistake to regard everything
not sacred as necessarily profane&mdash;was the descent of
Orpheus into the infernal regions, drawn thither, as is
well known, by his wife, Eurydice. The subject of
Orpheus, alike lyrical and dramatic, has been a favourite<a name="page_022" id="page_022"></a>
one with composers for the last four hundred years,
from Poliziano, who produced his <i>Orfeo</i> at Rome in 1440,
up to Gluck, nearly three centuries later, and from
Gluck down to Offenbach, who delights a good many
persons in the present day. The <i>Orfeo</i>, which was
brought out just four centuries ago, at Rome, bore no
more resemblance, in a musical point of view, to a
modern opera, than did the sacred musical plays before
spoken of; and up to the year 1600 we meet with no
musical work which bears more than a fundamental
or general sort of resemblance to the modern opera.
But almost immediately after the production of the
second <i>Eurydice</i> a great reformer appeared. Monteverde,
the innovator in question, changed, or at least
gave new development to, the harmonic system of
his predecessors, assigned far greater importance in
his operas to accompaniments, and increased greatly
both the number and the variety of the instruments
in the orchestra, which, under his arrangement, included
every kind of instrument known at the time.
Monteverde employed a separate combination of instruments
to announce the entry and return of each
personage in his operas; a dramatic means made use of
long afterwards by Hoffmann&mdash;better known by his
fantastic tales than by his musical works&mdash;in his opera
of <i>Undine</i>; and which cannot but suggest a similar
device employed with more system and with greater
elaboration by Wagner.</p>

<p>Monteverde, like so many of his predecessors and
followers, felt attracted by the story of Orpheus and
Eurydice, and his first work was on the subject of<a name="page_023" id="page_023"></a>
<i>Orfeo</i>, which was produced in 1608 at the Court of
Mantua; ordered, it may be, by that gallant but dissolute
Duke of Mantua whom Signor Mario used to
impersonate so admirably in <i>Rigoletto</i>. Monteverde's
<i>Orfeo</i> contained parts for harpsichords, lyres, violas,
double basses, a double harp with two rows of strings,
two violins, besides guitars, organs, a flute, clarions, and
even trombones. It is interesting to know that, apart
from the instrumental combinations which announced
the entry and return of each character, the bass-violas
accompanied Orpheus; the violas, Eurydice; the trombones,
Pluto; the organs, Apollo; while Charon&mdash;a
most unsentimental personage, one would think&mdash;sang
to the accompaniment of that sentimental instrument,
the guitar.</p>

<p>I have, of course, no intention of following out the
history of opera from Monteverde to Verdi. It will
be sufficient to remark that Monteverde, the real
founder of opera in something like its present form,
produced a number of works at Venice, until at last
the fame of the Venetian operas spread throughout
Italy, so that by the middle of the seventeenth century
the new entertainment was established at Verona,
Bologna, Rome, Turin, Naples, and Messina. Opera,
whatever its merits and defects, is essentially a royal
and aristocratic entertainment. The drama was started
by Thespis in a cart. The opera, on the other hand,
was founded by popes, cardinals, and kings. The first
operatic libretto, that of Poliziano's <i>Orfeo</i>, was the
work of Cardinal Riario, nephew of Sixtus IV. Pope
Clement IX. was the author of no less than seven<a name="page_024" id="page_024"></a>
libretti. The popes, indeed, used, in former days,
to keep up an excellent theatre; and even in these
degenerate times the taste for music has not, or had
not until lately, died out at the Vatican.</p>

<p>It has been said that the history of opera, though
Italy cannot claim to have been the one scene of its
development, can be more conveniently because more
continuously traced in Italy than in the various European
countries where it has been cultivated, and where,
in the case of three of these countries&mdash;Italy, Germany,
and France,&mdash;it has made distinct advances. Nor, in
considering the history of opera in Italy, is it necessary
to observe its progress in Italy generally. It is sufficient
to note the changes through which it passed at Naples
alone. From Scarlatti (end of the seventeenth to the
middle of the eighteenth century) to the immediate predecessors
of Rossini, the history of the development of
the opera in Italy is indeed the history of its development
at Naples; and though, unlike previous celebrated
composers, Rossini did not pursue his studies at Naples,
he soon made Naples his head-quarters, and produced at
the San Carlo theatre between the years 1815 and
1823 all his best Italian operas in the serious style:
<i>Otello</i>, for instance, <i>La Donna del Lago</i> and <i>Semiramide</i>.</p>

<p>Scarlatti, the founder of the great Neapolitan school,
studied at Rome under Carrissimi; and he is memorable
in musical history as having given new development
to the operatic air, while he introduced for the first
time measured recitative. Of Scarlatti's immediate followers,
Logroscino and Durante, the former introduced
concerted pieces and the dramatic finale which afterwards<a name="page_025" id="page_025"></a>
received new development at the hands of Piccinni.
This important feature to which modern opera owes so
much of its importance and so much of its effect, was
introduced into serious opera by Paisiello. Paisiello, like
Scarlatti, Logroscino and Durante, was professor at the
Conservatorio of Naples; and under his guidance were
formed Jomelli, Piccinni, Sacchini, Guglielmi, and
Cimarosa. The particular innovations due to Piccinni
and Paisiello have already been mentioned. Cimarosa
composed the best overtures which, up to his time, the
Italian school could boast of, and he was the first to introduce
quartets and other concerted pieces in the
midst of dramatic action; not, that is to say, as ornaments
at the end of an act, which hitherto had been the
place conventionally assigned to them, but as integral
parts of the musical drama. This innovation occurs for
the first time in <i>Il Fanatico per gli antichi Romani</i>, which
Cimarosa composed in 1773. It was not until nineteen
years afterwards that this master produced his <i>Matrimonio
Segreto</i>. But meanwhile Cimarosa had been
completely distanced by Mozart, who, himself a great
inventor, and, so to say, anticipator, adopted moreover
everything that was worth adopting in the methods
of all his contemporaries and predecessors.</p>

<p>To resume, in as few words as possible, the history of
opera in Italy up to the time of Rossini, this form of
art was at first nothing but recitative, or recitative with a
chorus at the end of each act. Then occasional airs were
introduced, then duets; and it is not until the middle of
the eighteenth century that we find an example of an
operatic trio. Quartets and dramatic finales followed in<a name="page_026" id="page_026"></a>
due course; and while the Italians had been developing
new methods of employing the solo voices, Gluck had
given prominence to the chorus as a dramatic factor, and
had cultivated choral writing with the happiest effect.
Other Germans, with Haydn foremost among them, had
produced new orchestral combinations, until at last
Mozart joined to the vocal forms of the Italians the
instrumental forms of the Germans, while developing
and perfecting both. Rossini introduced quite gradually
into Italian opera those reforms which are particularly
associated with his name; and perhaps in no other way
could he have got them accepted. But he might, had
he felt so disposed, have borrowed them one and all in
a piece from the works of Mozart.</p>

<p>Let it be remembered, however, as a matter of fact,
that when in 1813 Rossini produced <i>Tancredi</i>, which
marks the commencement of the reforms introduced
by him into serious opera, he had enjoyed no opportunity
of seeing any of Mozart's works on the stage.
Probably he had studied the music of Mozart, as we
know him to have studied that of Haydn, in score; but
it was not until 1814 that <i>Don Giovanni</i>, nor until 1815
that the <i>Marriage of Figaro</i>, was performed for the first
time in Italy at the Scala theatre.</p>

<p>Rossini's success, due above all to the fascinating
character of his easily appreciable melodies, was instantaneous;
and it spread like wild-fire from Italy all over
Europe. More than a quarter of a century, however,
passed before Mozart's great works made their way from
Vienna to the chief cities of Italy, and to the capitals
of France and England. This tardy recognition of<a name="page_027" id="page_027"></a>
Mozart's dramatic genius may be explained in part
by the outbreak of the French revolution soon after
their production, and by the wars which distracted
Europe from the time of the French revolution until
the pacification of 1815.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br /><br />
<small>TANCREDI.</small></h2>

<p><i>Tancredi</i>, composed a year after <i>La Pietra del Paragone</i>,
was Rossini's first serious opera. It was also
the first opera by which he became known throughout
Europe.</p>

<p>To amateurs of the present day its melodies appear of
old-fashioned, or at least of antique cast. The recitatives
seem long, and they are interminable compared with
those by which Verdi connects his musical pieces. But
when <i>Tancredi</i> was first brought out <i>opera seria</i> consisted
almost entirely of recitative, relieved here and
there and only at long intervals by solo airs. For much
of this declamation Rossini substituted singing; for
endless monologues and dialogues supported by a few
chords, concerted pieces connected and supported by a
brilliant orchestral accompaniment.</p>

<p>Rossini, in fact, introduced into serious opera the
forms which comic opera already possessed. The parts
were at that time differently distributed in <i>opera seria</i><a name="page_028" id="page_028"></a>
and <i>opera buffa</i>; and in the latter less restricted style the
bass singer was not as a matter of course kept in the
background. <i>Tancredi</i> was the first serious opera in which
a certain prominence was given to the bass, though it was
not until some years later&mdash;in <i>Otello</i>, 1816, in <i>La Gazza
Ladra</i>, 1817, and in <i>Mosè</i>, 1818&mdash;that Rossini ventured
to entrust bass singers with leading parts. <i>Opera seria</i>,
when Rossini was beginning his career, was governed by
rules as strict, as formal, and as thoroughly conventional
as those which gave so much artificiality and so much
dulness to the classical drama of France. The company
for comic opera consisted of the <i>primo buffo</i> (tenor),
<i>prima buffa</i>, <i>buffo caricato</i> (bass), <i>seconda buffa</i>, and
<i>ultima parte</i> (bass). The company for serious opera was
made up of the <i>primo uomo</i> (soprano), <i>prima donna</i>,
and tenor, the <i>secondo uomo</i> (soprano), <i>seconda donna</i>,
and <i>ultima parte</i> (bass); and in serious opera the
<i>ultima parte</i> was not only kept in the background,
but, except in concerted pieces, was scarcely ever
heard.</p>

<p>As a solo singer, the bass in serious opera had no
existence. Gradually Rossini brought him forward,
until he became at last as prominent as the tenor, or
even more so. In <i>Semiramide</i>, for instance, the principal
male character is Assur. In <i>Tancredi</i>, from which
<i>Semiramide</i> is separated by an interval of ten years,
the bass has little to do. He already, however, possesses
an importance which was denied to him in the
serious operas of Rossini's predecessors.</p>

<p>In <i>Tancredi</i>, again, the composer introduces concerted
pieces in situations where, had the ancient method been<a name="page_029" id="page_029"></a>
followed, there would have been only monologues. In
these concerted pieces, moreover, the dramatic action is
kept up, whereas the endless monologues and long
sequences of airs which gave such character as they possessed
to the operas of Rossini's immediate predecessors
had the effect of delaying it. To musical reformers of
a later period Rossini himself seemed to insert songs in
his operas merely for the sake of singing, and greatly to
the injury of the drama. But he diminished considerably
the number of formal airs which, until he began
to write, were included as a matter of course in every
opera. He increased the number of characters, and
made, for the first time in Italian opera, a free use of
the chorus, which in the works of the old school
plays quite a subordinate part and has no dramatic
functions assigned to it at all.</p>

<p>Rossini's innovations are well described by Lord
Mount-Edgcumbe, who has no praise, however, to bestow
upon them, but on the contrary, condemns them without
measure. Indeed, the more he blames Rossini, the more
he calls attention to what are now recognised as his
chief merits. When Lord Mount-Edgcumbe undertakes
to show how Rossini was ruining the musical drama, he
in fact points out how he was reforming it. "So great
a change," he writes, "has taken place in the character
of the (operatic) dramas, in the style of the music and
its performance, that I cannot help enlarging upon that
subject before we proceed further. One of the most
material alterations is that the grand distinction between
serious and comic operas is nearly at an end, the
separation of the singers for their performances entirely<a name="page_030" id="page_030"></a>
so. Not only do the same sing in both, but a new
species of drama has arisen, a kind of mongrel between
them, called <i>semi-seria</i>, which bears the same analogy to
the other two that the nondescript melodrama does to
the legitimate tragedy and comedy of the English stage.
The construction of these newly invented pieces," continues
Lord Mount-Edgcumbe, "is essentially different
from the old. The dialogue, which used to be carried on
in recitative, and which in Metastasio's operas is often
so beautiful and interesting, is now cut up (and rendered
unintelligible if it were worth listening to) into
<i>pezzi concertati</i>, or long singing conversations, which present
a tedious succession of unconnected, ever-changing
<i>motivos</i>, having nothing to do with each other; and if a
satisfactory air is for a moment introduced, which the
ear would like to dwell upon, to hear modulated, varied,
and again returned to, it is broken off, before it is well
understood, by a sudden transition into a totally different
melody, time, and key, and recurs no more, so that
no impression can be made or recollection of it preserved.
Single songs are almost exploded ... even the prima
donna, who would formerly have complained at
having less than three or four airs allotted to her,
is now satisfied with one trifling <i>cavatina</i> for a whole
opera."</p>

<p>In his valuable attack upon Rossini, Lord Mount-Edgcumbe
is admirably sincere. After condemning
Rossini for his new distribution of characters, and for
his employment of bass voices in leading parts, "to
the manifest injury of melody and total subversion of
harmony, in which the lowest part is their peculiar<a name="page_031" id="page_031"></a>
province," he calls attention to the fact that Mozart has
previously sinned in like manner; and he cannot help
expressing some astonishment when he reflects "that
the principal characters in two of Mozart's operas have
been written for basses." It might have occurred to
him, moreover, that Mozart, both in <i>Don Giovanni</i> and
in the <i>Magic Flute</i>, united the serious with the comic,
and, indeed, that there was not one of the so-called
innovations charged against Rossini, which were not
in reality due to Mozart. In Italy, where Mozart's
works were at the time unknown, Rossini may well
have appeared a perfectly original genius, not only
by his richness of melodic invention, but also by the
novelty of his forms. But it is strange that an amateur,
acquainted, as Lord Mount-Edgcumbe was, with the
works of Mozart, should not at once have perceived that
Rossini, in introducing so much which was new only
to the Italians, was making no bold experiment, but
was merely following in the wake of a greater inventor
than himself.</p>

<p>The success, however, of Rossini's first serious opera
was due less to new methods of distributing parts and
of constructing pieces than to the beauty of the melodies.
Stendhal, in his always ingenious but seldom quite
veracious <i>Vie de Rossini</i>, dwells on the sort of fever
with which its tuneful themes inspired the whole
Venetian population, so that even in the law-courts the
judges, he relates, were obliged to direct the ushers to
stop the singing of "Di tanti palpiti" and "Mi rivedrai
ti rivedrò." "I thought that after hearing my opera,"
wrote Rossini himself, "the Venetians would think me<a name="page_032" id="page_032"></a>
mad. Not at all: I found they were much madder
than I was."</p>

<p>"It is said at Venice," writes Stendhal, "that the
first idea of this delicious <i>cantilena</i>, which expresses so
well the joy of meeting after a long absence, is taken
from a Greek litany; Rossini had heard it a few days
before at vespers in the church of one of the little
islands of the lagoons of Venice."</p>

<p>"Since its production," says M. Azevedo, "on the
stage and in the universe, it has been made the subject
of a canticle for the Catholic Church, like all other
successful airs. But a litany before the air, and a
canticle after the air, are not the same thing."</p>

<p>In connection with <i>Tancredi</i>, mention has been made
of Rossini's reforms in serious opera, which he found
too serious. Comic opera, on the other hand, as it
existed up to his time, seemed to him too comic or
rather, too extravagant. We have seen that the old
<i>opera buffa</i> had its separate set of characters and
singers, and its own separate style, musical as well as
dramatic. Rossini raised the level of the style, and
for farce substituted comedy. In the midst, too, of
comedy airs, he introduced, from time to time, a sentimental
one such as "Ecco ridente" in <i>Il Barbiere</i>, and
"Languir per una bella," in <i>L'Italiana in Algeri</i>&mdash;which
Rossini brought out at Milan (1813) soon after the
production of <i>Tancredi</i> at Venice, and which holds
among his comic operas the same position that belongs
to <i>Tancredi</i> among his serious ones.</p>

<p>Italian audiences had been trained to disapprove of
the same singer appearing one night in a comic and<a name="page_033" id="page_033"></a>
the next in a tragic part; and critical hearers are said
to have been shocked at seeing the same artist appear
successively as Figaro and as Assur, as Dr. Bartolo and
as Mosè. Apart from the substitution of the comic for
the farcical in the general treatment, <i>L'Italiana in Algeri</i>
is remarkable as the first comic opera in which Rossini
introduced that <i>crescendo</i>, which was soon recognised as
a characteristic feature in all his works. He had already
tested its effect in the overture to <i>Tancredi</i>&mdash;the first
Italian overture which became popular apart from the
work to which it belonged&mdash;and in the concerted <i>finale</i>
of the same opera. Rossini is said to have borrowed
this effect from Paisiello's <i>Re Teodoro</i>. But the invention
of the <i>crescendo</i> was energetically claimed by
Mosca, who had certainly employed it before Rossini,
and who regarded it as his own private property;
circulating, in order to establish his prior right, copies
of a piece composed long before <i>Tancredi</i> was brought
out, in which fully developed <i>crescendi</i> occurred. This
did not prevent Rossini from continuing to write
<i>crescendi</i>, nor from being satirised and caricatured as
"Signor Crescendo," when, some ten years afterwards,
he went to Paris.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.<br /><br />
<small>OPERATIC CUSTOMS IN ROSSINI'S TIME.</small></h2>

<p>T<small>HE</small> year after the production of <i>Tancredi</i>, Rossini,
in 1814, brought out <i>Aureliano</i>, which was not successful.
It contained, however, at least one piece of music<a name="page_034" id="page_034"></a>
which the composer, with due regard to economy, was
determined not to waste. This was the introduction
itself, borrowed from <i>Ciro in Babilonia</i>, which, when
Rossini afterwards adapted its melody to words written
for Count Almaviva in the <i>Barber of Seville</i>, obtained
lasting success in the form of the charming cavatina
"Ecco ridente il cielo."</p>

<p>The overture, moreover, to <i>Aureliano in Palmira</i>,
after serving as instrumental introduction to <i>Elisabetta</i>,
produced a year later at Naples, found ultimately a
permanent position as musical preface to the <i>Barber of
Seville</i>. The failure of <i>Aureliano in Palmira</i>, which
Rossini attributed in a great measure to the liberties
taken with the music by at least one of the performers,
caused him to adopt the practice of writing for the
singers the very notes he intended them to sing.
Strange innovation! But, until Rossini's time, the vocalists
were really the composer's masters, and regarded
his airs merely as so much canvas for embroidery.</p>

<p>To Rossini belongs the honour of having helped
greatly to expel the sopranists from the operatic stage.
The Church, with a view to soprano voices in choirs,
from which women were excluded, had introduced
them; and ultimately the Church pronounced against
them. But nothing could have had a greater effect
in putting them down than Rossini's absolute refusal to
write for them, or to allow them to sing in those of his
operas performed under his direct superintendence.</p>

<p>The circumstances under which Rossini broke with
the most celebrated sopranist of his time&mdash;that Velluti,
whom a wit described as "<i>non vir sed veluti</i>"&mdash;are worth<a name="page_035" id="page_035"></a>
relating. Rossini had written for this personage a part
in his <i>Aureliano in Palmira</i> (1814), the most celebrated
of his very few failures; and the composer soon found
that the singer had no respect for his music, which he
treated as so much substance for elaboration and
pretended adornment; while the singer discovered that
the composer was so narrow-minded as to require his
melodies to be sung as he had thought fit to write them.
In those days dramatic propriety and music itself were
sacrificed to the vocalists, who, far from studying parts,
do not seem, in any true spirit, to have mastered airs.
We read of singers having been kept to scales and
passages for years at a time; and every one who takes
an interest in musical history must remember the burlesque
exclamation of Porpora, who, when Caffarelli had
practised nothing but exercises with him for no less
than five years, cried out: "You have nothing more to
learn! Caffarelli is the first singer in the world!"</p>

<p><i>Aureliano</i> was not played after the first night: and
Rossini had the satisfaction of hearing that though
his opera had failed, Velluti had made a brilliant
success in the principal part. Velluti had, in fact,
astonished and delighted the public by his vocal gymnastics.
But it was not Rossini's music, it was really
his own music, suggested by Rossini's, that he had sung.</p>

<p>Unable&mdash;perhaps even unwilling&mdash;to run altogether
counter to the prevailing taste, Rossini continued to
write highly florid music. But he supplied his own
decorations, and made them so elaborate that the most
skilful adorner would have found it difficult to add
to them.<a name="page_036" id="page_036"></a></p>

<p>Writing for a French public Rossini showed, in
<i>William Tell</i>, that he was as much a master of the simple
dramatic style in which the singer has not to display
vocal agility, but to express human emotion, as he was
already known to be of the highly decorative style
admired by the Italians. "Rossini," says Stendhal, in
his interesting account of the first representation of
<i>Aureliano in Palmira</i>, which he claims to have witnessed,
"followed in his first works the style of his
predecessors. He respected the voices, and only thought
of bringing about the triumph of singing. Such is
the system in which he composed <i>Demetrio e Polibio</i>,
<i>L'Inganno felice</i>, <i>La Pietra del Paragone</i>, <i>Tancredi</i>, &amp;c.
Rossini had found La Marcolini, La Malanotte, La
Manfredini, the Mombelli family, why should he
not endeavour to give prominence to the singing&mdash;he
who is such a good singer, and who when he sits down
to the piano to sing one of his own airs, seems to transform
the genius we know him to possess as a composer
into that of a singer? The fact is, a little event took
place which at once changed the composer's views....
Rossini arrived at Milan in 1814, to write <i>Aureliano in
Palmira</i>. There he met with Velluti, who was to sing
in his opera; Velluti, then in the flower of his youth
and talent, one of the best-looking men of his time, and
much given to abuse his prodigious resources. Rossini
had never heard this singer. He wrote a cavatina for
him. At the first rehearsal, with full orchestra, he
heard Velluti sing it, and was struck with admiration.
At the second rehearsal Velluti began to
embroider (<i>fiorire</i>). Rossini found some of his effects<a name="page_037" id="page_037"></a>
admirable, and still approved; but at the third rehearsal,
the richness of the embroidery was such that it
quite concealed the body of the air. At last the grand
day of the first representation arrived. The cavatina,
and all Velluti's part, was enthusiastically applauded;
but Rossini could scarcely recognise what Velluti was
singing; he did not know his own music. However,
Velluti's singing was very beautiful and wonderfully
successful with the public, which, after all, does no
wrong in applauding what gives it so much pleasure.
The pride of the young composer was deeply wounded;
the opera failed, and the sopranist alone succeeded.
Rossini's lively perception saw at once all that such an
event could suggest. 'It is by a fortunate accident,'
he said to himself, 'that Velluti happens to be a
singer of taste, but how am I to know that at the
next theatre I write for I shall not find another singer,
who, with a flexible throat and an equal mania for
<i>fioriture</i>, will not spoil my music so as to render it not
only unrecognisable to me, but also wearisome to the
public, or at least remarkable only for some details of
execution? The danger to my unfortunate music is
the more imminent, insomuch as there are no more
singing schools in Italy. The theatres are full of
artists who have picked up music from singing-masters
about the country. This style of singing violin concertos,
endless variations, will not only destroy all
talent for singing, but will also vitiate the public
taste. All the singers will be imitating Velluti,
each according to his means. We shall have no
more cantilenas; they would be thought poor and cold.<a name="page_038" id="page_038"></a>
Everything will undergo a change, even to the nature
of the voices, which, once accustomed to embroider and
overlay a cantilena with elaborate ornaments, will soon
lose the habit of singing sustained <i>legato</i> passages, and be
unable to execute them. I must change my system then.
I know how to sing; every one acknowledges that I
possess that talent; my <i>fioriture</i> will be in good taste;
moreover, I shall discover at once the strong and weak
points of my singers, and shall only write for them
what they will be able to execute. I will not leave
them a place for adding the least <i>apoggiatura</i>. The
<i>fioriture</i>, the ornaments, must form an integral part of
the air, and be all written in the score.'"</p>

<p>The sopranists might, at an earlier period, have been
sent with advantage to Berlin, where, as Dr. Burney
tells us, Frederick the Great, taking up his position in
the pit of his opera-house immediately behind the conductor
of the orchestra, on whose score he kept his eye,
would never allow a singer to alter a single passage in
his part. The conductor's authority does not seem to
have been sufficient, for, according to Burney, it was
the king who, when the vocalist took liberties with the
score, called upon him to keep to the notes as written
by the composer. "The sopranists," says M. Castil-Blaze,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
"were at all times extremely insolent. They
forced the greatest masters to conform to their caprices.
They changed, transformed everything to suit their own
vanity. They would insist on having an air or a duet
placed in such a scene, written in such a style, with
such an accompaniment. They were the kings, the<a name="page_039" id="page_039"></a>
tyrants of theatres, managers, and composers; that is
why, in the most serious works of the greatest masters
of the last century, there occur long cold passages of
vocalisation which had been exacted by the sopranists for
the sake of exhibiting, in a striking manner, the agility
and power of their throats. 'You will be kind enough
to sing my music and not yours,' said the venerable and
formidable Guglielmi, to a certain <i>virtuoso</i>, threatening
him at the same time with his sword. In fact the vocal
music, and the whole Italian lyrical system of the
eighteenth century, was much more the work of the
singers than of the composers."</p>

<p>After the production of <i>Aureliano in Palmira</i>, Rossini
for about eighteen months was comparatively idle; for
during this period he only produced two operas, <i>Il Turco
in Italia</i>, and <i>Sigismondo</i>, of which the former has long
ceased to-be played, while the latter was never at any
time much performed. <i>Il Turco in Italia</i> was a pendant
to <i>L'Italiana in Algeri</i>, but it obtained no greater
amount of public favour than continuations usually
meet with. The hero of the work was supposed to
have been wrecked on the Italian coast, and a like fate
awaited the work itself. Rossini, according to his custom,
saved what he could from the wreck, and the
overture to the <i>Turk in Italy</i> was, some years later,
when <i>Otello</i> was brought out, made to do duty as introduction
to the story of the Moor of Venice.</p>

<p>As for <i>Sigismondo</i>, the story of its failure was graphically
recorded by Rossini himself; who, writing to his
mother the same night, enclosed her the outline of a
small bottle or fiasco.<a name="page_040" id="page_040"></a></p>

<p>Rossini's increasing fame had, among other effects,
that of making him visit all the principal cities in Italy.
As in his youth he had moved about in his character of
conductor from one little town in the Romagna to another,
so now, when he had attained his full powers, he was
called upon to travel from Bologna to Venice, from
Venice to Milan, from Milan to Naples, from Naples to
Rome. The two leading theatres of the Peninsula were
then, as now, the San Carlo of Naples, and the Scala of
Milan. The former received a subvention of 12,000<i>l</i>.
from the King of Naples, the latter one of 8,000<i>l</i>. from the
Emperor of Austria. These opera-houses, at that time
the first in the world, received additional support from
public gambling saloons adjoining them; and it was as
a waiter at one of these auxiliary establishments that
Barbaja, the most illustrious impresario of his own
or of any other time&mdash;Barbaja, who is mentioned in
one of Balzac's novels, and introduced by Scribe in his
libretto of <i>La Sirène</i>&mdash;commenced his career. Besides
the cities already named, Turin, Florence, Bergamo,
Genoa, Leghorn, Sienna, Ferrara, had all their opera-houses;
some of which were supported by state grants,
others by grants from the municipality. Occasionally,
too, the necessary operatic subvention was furnished
by some local magnate, who either made a liberal
donation or constituted himself director of the theatre.
The chief towns maintained several opera-houses. There
were three at Venice&mdash;the Fenice, the San Benedetto,
and the San Mosè; and five at Rome&mdash;the Argentina,
the Valle, the Apollo, the Alberto, and the Tordinona.
Next to San Carlo and La Scala ranked the Fenice,<a name="page_041" id="page_041"></a>
and next to the Fenice the Court Theatre of Turin
where, inasmuch as it formed part of the king's palace,
it was considered 'disrespectful to appear in a cloak,
disrespectful to laugh, and disrespectful to applaud till
the queen had applauded.'</p>

<p>From 1815 to 1823 Rossini wrote principally for
Naples. But we have seen that he also worked for
Bologna, Venice, and Milan; and he composed for the
opera-houses of Rome, <i>Il Barbiere</i>, brought out at the
Argentina Theatre, <i>La Cenerentola</i>, produced at the Valle
Theatre, and <i>Matilda di Sabran</i>, performed for the first
time at the Apollo Theatre. At the Fenice of Venice,
Rossini's first opera in the serious style, <i>Tancredi</i>
(1813), and also his last in that style, <i>Semiramide</i>
(1823), were produced. For the Court Theatre of Turin
Rossini wrote nothing.</p>

<p>Each of the great Italian opera-houses made a point
of bringing out at least two new operas every year;
and as the minor theatres were also frequently supplied
with new works there was no lack of opportunity for
composers anxious to place themselves before the public.
The composers were not liberally paid by managers&mdash;40<i>l</i>.
was considered a fair price for an opera; while
from the publishers they received absolutely nothing for
the right of engraving. It has already been mentioned
that Rossini never troubled himself about the publication
of his works, and that he profited by the fact of their not
having been engraved to borrow from his failures pieces
which, had the scores been before the public, he must
have hesitated to re-adopt.</p>

<p>The operas of that day were in two acts; a division<a name="page_042" id="page_042"></a>
which, when the subject was an important one, scarcely
conduced to the maintenance of dramatic interest. It
was the custom of the time, however, to separate these
two acts by a ballet; and thus kept apart they were not
found so long, so interminable, as, performed one after
the other without a break, our modern audiences would
find them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br /><br />
<small>ROSSINI AT NAPLES.</small></h2>

<p>B<small>ARBAJA</small>, the ex-waiter at the Ridotto of the San
Carlo Theatre, was director of the San Carlo itself, and
almost at the height of his glory, which Rossini was so
much to increase, when <i>Tancredi</i> was brought out at
Venice and <i>L'Italiana in Algeri</i> at Milan.</p>

<p>The year following was not for Rossini a very brilliant
one; and neither <i>Aureliano in Palmira</i>, nor a cantata
called <i>Egle e Irene</i>, written for the Princess Belgiojoso,
nor <i>Il Turco in Italia</i>&mdash;all of the year 1814&mdash;did much
to increase his reputation. But the success of <i>Tancredi</i>
and of <i>L'Italiana in Algeri</i> was enough for Barbaja,
who accordingly invited Rossini in 1814 to come to
Naples and compose something for the San Carlo.
On his arrival Rossini signed a contract with Barbaja
for several years; binding himself to write two new
operas annually, and to re-arrange the music of any<a name="page_043" id="page_043"></a>
old works the manager might wish to produce, either
at his principal theatre or at the second Neapolitan
opera-house, the Teatro del Fondo, of which also
Barbaja was lessee. Rossini's emoluments were to be
40<i>l.</i> (200 ducats) a month with a share in the profits of
the gambling saloon. Such an engagement would not
seem very magnificent to a second or third rate composer
of our own time. But it was better than
40<i>l.</i> an opera, at which rate Rossini had hitherto been
paid. Provided, moreover, that he supplied Barbaja
with his two new operas every year he was at liberty to
write for other managers.</p>

<p>In the present day it is not uncommon to find an
operatic manager of enterprise directing two lyrical
theatres in two different countries. Mr. Lumley was
manager at the same time of Her Majesty's Theatre in
London and of the Théâtre des Italiens in Paris. The
late Mr. Gye entered into an arrangement (which however
was not carried out) for directing the Imperial
Opera House of St. Petersburg, while he was at the same
time managing the Royal Italian Opera of London. Mr.
Mapleson directs simultaneously Her Majesty's Theatre
in London, and the Italian Opera which he has recently
established at the so-called Academy of Music in New
York. But these feats are nothing compared with the
performances of Barbaja in the managerial line. It is
much easier at the present time to get from London
to New York or from London to St. Petersburg, than
it was in the days of Barbaja to move from Naples or
even from Milan to Vienna; and a manager must have
possessed great administrative ability who could direct<a name="page_044" id="page_044"></a>
three operatic enterprises in three different capitals at
the same time.</p>

<p>Barbaja had in his employment all the great composers
and all the best singers of his native Italy. So
numerous was his company that he scarcely knew who
did and who did not belong to it; and a story is told of
his meeting one day a singer of some celebrity, and offering
him an engagement&mdash;when, to his consternation and
horror, the vocalist informed him that he had been
drawing a regular salary from the theatre for the last
three months. "Go to Donizetti," cried Barbaja, "and
tell him to give you a part without a moment's delay."</p>

<p>On one occasion Donizetti, engaged at that time as
accompanist at the Scala Theatre, had been requested
to try the voice of a lady who had come to Barbaja
with a letter of recommendation. Donizetti asked
her to go through a few exercises in solfeggio; on
which Barbaja, mistaking <i>do</i>, <i>re</i>, <i>mi</i>, &amp;c., for the words
of some outlandish tongue, exclaimed that it would be
useless to sing in a foreign language, and that the postulant
for an engagement had better carry her talents
elsewhere. Another time, when a favourite vocalist
complained that the piano, to whose accompaniment
she had been rehearsing her part, was too high, Barbaja
at once promised that before the next rehearsal he would
have it lowered. The following morning the instrument
was, as before, half a note above the requisite
pitch. It was pointed out to Barbaja that the piano
still wanted lowering; upon which he flew into a violent
passion and, summoning one of the stage carpenters,
asked him why, when he had been told that the piano<a name="page_045" id="page_045"></a>
was too high, he had not shortened it by two or three
inches instead of doing so only by one.</p>

<p>When his singers were genuinely successful he would
take their part under all circumstances, and defend them
against every attack. A popular prima donna told him
one day, on arriving at the San Carlo Theatre, whither
she had been borne in a sedan-chair, that one of the
carriers had been very negligent in his duty, and had
allowed her several times to be bumped on the ground.
Barbaja called the porters to his room and, giving each
a box on the ears, exclaimed, "Which of you two brutes
was in fault?"</p>

<p>For the sake of teasing Barbaja, a few of the subscribers
to the Scala Theatre agreed one night to hiss
Rubini in one of his best parts. Barbaja, perfectly
aghast, looked from his box, shook his fist at the
seeming malcontents, and, alike indignant and enthusiastic,
called out to the universally-admired tenor:
"Bravo, Rubini, never mind those pigs! It is I who
pay you, and I am delighted with your singing."</p>

<p>In spite of his long-continued success, Barbaja ended,
like so many managers, by failing; and but that he
stood well with the Austrian Government, who gave
him a contract for building barracks at Milan, he might
have died in poverty. There is nothing, however, to
show that his collapse was due to ignorance of music.
It would be probably nearer the truth to attribute it to
that loss of energy and tact by which advancing years
are generally accompanied.</p>

<p>Among the <i>prime donne</i> of the San Carlo Theatre
Barbaja's favourite, in the fullest sense of the word,<a name="page_046" id="page_046"></a>
was Mademoiselle Colbran, who, after studying under
Crescentini and Marinelli, made her first appearance
with brilliant success at Paris in 1801. She was then
but sixteen years of age, having been born at Madrid
in 1785. When Rossini, then, first met her at Naples
in 1815, she was already thirty. Her voice began
to deteriorate soon afterwards, if we are to believe
Stendhal&mdash;who, much as he had in common with the
Abbé Carpani (including nearly the whole of the
materials for his <i>Life of Rossini</i>), did not share that
writer's admiration for a singer whom it was the fashion
for royalists to laud, for republicans to decry. Stendhal,
though he feared that opera, accustomed to subventions
and to patronage of all kinds, could not flourish under
republican institutions, was nevertheless inclined towards
republicanism.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Colbran has been described as a great
beauty in the queenly style&mdash;dark hair, brilliant eyes,
imposing demeanour; and though Stendhal is under the
impression that her voice began to fall off soon after
Rossini's arrival at Naples, it seems certain that she
must have preserved it in all its beauty until long
afterwards. Rossini in any case wrote for her many of
his best parts which, had they not been perfectly sung,
could scarcely have met with the success they actually
obtained. Among these parts may be mentioned in
particular those of Desdemona, Elcia in <i>Mosè in Egitto</i>,
Elena in <i>La Donna del Lago</i>, Zelmira in the opera of
that name, and Semiramide. The artistic merits of
Mademoiselle Colbran were, however, as has already
been mentioned, discussed habitually from a political<a name="page_047" id="page_047"></a>
point of view. Revolutionists hissed her because the
king admired her, while royalists were ready under
all circumstances to applaud her. The first part which
Rossini composed for Mademoiselle Colbran, his future
wife, was that of <i>Elisabetta</i> in the opera of the same
name; a work founded on Scott's novel of <i>Kenilworth</i>,
and written appropriately enough by a certain Signor
Smith. Smith's knowledge of the English language
seems, in spite of his name, to have been imperfect;
for, instead of taking his story direct from the original,
he borrowed it in an adapted shape from a French
melodrama.</p>

<p>The Neapolitans, up to this time, had not heard a
note of Rossini's music. He had conquered the hearts
of the Venetians and the Milanese. But he was unknown
at Naples; and not to have earned the applause
of the Neapolitan public was not to have achieved an
Italian reputation. The connoisseurs of Naples were
by no means disposed to accept Rossini on the strength
of the success he had achieved at Milan and Venice;
while the professors of the famous Conservatorio, whose
classes he had not followed, were incredulous as to his
being a composer of any sound musical learning, and
were quite prepared to find him a much overrated
man.</p>

<p>Rossini began by playing a trick on the Neapolitan
audience; for in lieu of an original composition, he
prefaced <i>Elisabetta</i> with an overture which he had
written the year before at Milan for <i>Aureliano in
Palmira</i>&mdash;and which he was to offer to the Romans
a year afterwards as overture to <i>Il Barbiere</i>. The<a name="page_048" id="page_048"></a>
Neapolitans were delighted with the overture; but it
has been surmised that had they known it to have been
originally composed for an opera which had failed at
Milan, they would not, perhaps, have applauded it so
much. The first piece in the opera was, as Stendhal
tells us, a duet for Leicester and his young wife, in the
minor, which, says Stendhal, was "very original." The
finale to the first act, in which the leading motives of
the overture were introduced, called forth enthusiastic
applause. "All the emotions of serious opera with
no tedious intervals between:" such, Stendhal (or
Carpani) informs us, was the phrase in which the
general verdict of the Neapolitan public was expressed.
Mademoiselle Colbran's greatest success, however, was
not achieved until the second act where, on the rising
of the curtain, Elisabetta, attired in an historical
costume&mdash;warranted authentic and ordered expressly
from London by a fanatical English admirer&mdash;had
a grand scena. The concerted finale to this act was
another triumph both for the composer and for the
singers.</p>

<p><i>Elisabetta</i> made but little mark beyond the frontiers of
Italy. It contains much beautiful music; but the distribution
of characters is not all that could be desired.
Thus the parts of Norfolk, and of Leicester, are both
given to tenors; though Norfolk as a wicked personage
should have been represented by a baritone or bass.
The bass singer, however, was still kept in the background;
and at the San Carlo, though there were three
admirable tenors&mdash;Davide, Nozzari, and Garcia,&mdash;there
was no bass singer capable of taking a leading part.<a name="page_049" id="page_049"></a>
But for Rossini the bass singer might have remained
indefinitely in obscurity. Gradually, however, he was
brought to the front, not only in comic operas, where
the Italians already tolerated him, but also in serious
operas like <i>Otello</i> and <i>Semiramide</i>, and in half-character
works such as <i>Cenerentola</i> and <i>La Gazza Ladra</i>.
<i>Elisabetta</i> was the first Italian opera in which recitative
was accompanied by the stringed quartet in place
of the double bass and piano previously employed.</p>

<p>Rossini had plenty of work to do at Naples, for, besides
composing two new operas every year he had to
transpose parts and to correct and complete operatic
scores. But in addition to all this he found time to
write two works for Rome, which were produced in
1816, during the carnival. One of these, <i>Torvaldo e Dorliska</i>,
was brought out at the Teatro Valle where it met
with so little success that the composer informed his
mother of the fact by sending her the drawing, not this
time of a full-sized <i>fiasco</i>, but of a small <i>fiasco</i> or <i>fiaschetto</i>.
<i>Torvaldo e Dorliska</i>, in which the principal
parts were written for Remorini and Galli, the two best
bass singers of their time, and for Donzelli, the celebrated
tenor, must in spite of its failure have possessed
some merit. It was performed at Paris in 1825 for the
first appearance of Mademoiselle Garcia, the future
Malibran; and Rossini borrowed from it the motive
of the admirable letter duet in <i>Otello</i>.<a name="page_050" id="page_050"></a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br /><br />
<small>PREPARATIONS FOR THE BARBER.</small></h2>

<p><i>Torvaldo e Dorliska</i> was followed, after but a short
interval, by <i>Il Barbiere</i>, for which a contract was signed
the very day, Dec. 26, on which <i>Torvaldo</i> was brought
out. The contract was in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<p>"<i>Nobil Teatro di Torre Argentina</i>, Dec. 26th, 1815.</p>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<p>"By the present act, drawn up privately between the
parties, the value of which is not thereby diminished,
and according to the conditions consented to by them, it
has been stipulated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Signor Puca Sforza Cesarini, manager of the above-named
theatre, engages Signor Maestro Gioachino Rossini
for the next carnival season of the year 1816; and
the said Rossini promises and binds himself to compose
and produce on the stage, the second comic drama to be
represented in the said season at the theatre indicated,
and to the libretto which shall be given to him by the
said manager, whether this libretto be old or new. The
Maestro Rossini engages himself to deliver his score in
the middle of the month of January, and to adapt it to
the voices of the singers; obliging himself, moreover,
to make, if necessary, all the changes which may be<a name="page_051" id="page_051"></a>
required, as much for the good execution of the music as
to suit the capabilities or exigencies of the singers.</p>

<p>"The Maestro Rossini also promises and binds himself
to be at Rome and to fulfil his engagement not later than
the end of December of the current year, and to deliver
to the copyist the first act of his opera, quite complete,
on the 20th January, 1816. The 20th January is mentioned
in order that the partial and general rehearsals
may be commenced at once, and that the piece may be
brought out the day the director wishes, the date of the
first representation being hereby fixed for about the 5th
of February. And the Maestro Rossini shall also deliver
to the copyist, at the time wished, his second act, so
that there may be time to make arrangements, and to
terminate the rehearsals soon enough to go before the
public on the evening mentioned above; otherwise the
Maestro Rossini will expose himself to all losses, because
so it must be and not otherwise.</p>

<p>"The Maestro Rossini shall, moreover, be obliged to
direct his opera according to the custom, and to assist
personally at all the vocal and orchestral rehearsals as
many times as it shall be necessary, either at the theatre
or elsewhere, at the will of the director; he obliges himself
also to assist at the three first representations, to be
given consecutively, and to direct the execution at the
piano; and that because so it must be, and not otherwise.
In reward for his fatigues the director engages to pay to
the Maestro Rossini the sum and quantity of 400 Roman
scudi, as soon as the first three representations which he
is to direct at the piano shall be terminated.</p>

<p>"It is also agreed that in case of the piece being<a name="page_052" id="page_052"></a>
forbidden, or the theatre closed by the act of the
authority, or for any unforeseen reason, the habitual
practice in such cases, at the theatres of Rome and of all
other countries shall be observed.</p>

<p>"And to guarantee the complete execution of this
agreement, it shall be signed by the manager, and also
by the Maestro Gioachino Rossini; and, in addition,
the said manager grants lodgings to the Maestro Rossini
during the term of the agreement, in the same house
that is assigned to Signor Luigi Zamboni."</p>

<p>It is not certain, however, that Rossini received as
much as 400 scudi (about 80<i>l.</i>) for his <i>Barber</i>, for
Rossini, consulted long afterwards as to the correctness
of the figures given in the contract, said he was under
the impression that he had only received 300 scudi, or
about 60<i>l.</i><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> For the copyright of the music he received
not a farthing. He did not even take the trouble to get
it engraved; and two of the pieces, the overture (for
which the overture to <i>Elisabetta</i>, previously known as
the overture to <i>Aureliano in Palmira</i>, was afterwards substituted)
and the scene of the music lesson (which Rossini
had treated as a trio for the music-master, his pupil, and
the pupil's guardian), were somehow lost in the theatre.</p>

<p>What the manager, on his side, purchased from Rossini,
was the right of representation for two years; after
which the work might be played by any one, as it might<a name="page_053" id="page_053"></a>
from the first moment be engraved by any one, without
payment of any kind. The manuscript could not naturally
find its way into the publisher's hands without the
composer's consent. But as a matter of custom composers
received nothing from the publishers. In England,
curiously enough, operatic composers have hitherto,
with scarcely an exception, looked exclusively to the
publishers for their profits, and have received nothing
from the managers. The representation, according to
the English view, serves to advertise the work, and to
cause a demand at the music shops for the principal
pieces. In Italy the engraved music did not apparently
find many purchasers. The public cared above all
things to hear the music executed on the stage; and with
a view to the gratification of this desire the directors
found it necessary to provide them constantly with new
works, which they moreover found it necessary to order
and to pay for.</p>

<p>The manager of the Argentina Theatre had experienced
some trouble in procuring a suitable subject for the libretto
he wished Rossini to set. The censorship was exercised
with great severity, or rather with great scrupulosity, by
the so-called Patriarch of Constantinople&mdash;<i>Patriarchus
in partibus infidelium</i> and if, instead of Beaumarchais'
<i>Barber of Seville</i>, Cesarini had proposed the same
author's <i>Marriage of Figaro</i>, it is tolerably certain
that the Patriarch would have refused to license so
revolutionary a drama. When the politically harmless
<i>Barber of Seville</i> was suggested, the censor at once approved.
But it was now for Rossini to hesitate. To
object, he had by the terms of his agreement no right;<a name="page_054" id="page_054"></a>
since he had undertaken to set any libretto that might
be given to him, "new or old." The masters of the
eighteenth century accepted readily for their operas
themes which had been treated again and again, and
even actual libretti to which, several times over, music
had been composed. Almost every composer, for instance,
had tried his hand on Dido Abandoned, or on the
Descent of Orpheus into the Infernal Regions; and we
have seen that the story of Dido and the story of
Orpheus were both treated by Rossini in his early days.
Rossini, however, had now ideas of his own on the subject
of musical setting, on the subject of dramatic propriety,
and probably also on that of the propriety of taking for
his theme one that had already been dealt with very successfully
by a composer of high repute. Doubtless, in
spite of his agreement, he would have refused altogether
to take the <i>Marriage of Figaro</i> as subject of an opera,
for we know by his recorded conversations with Ferdinand
Hiller, that he regarded Mozart as the greatest of
all dramatic composers. He felt, too, some delicacy, perhaps
even some diffidence, in adopting the verses on which
the illustrious Paisiello had already worked. He explained
to Cesarini how impossible it would be for him
to attack the identical libretto which Paisiello had set;
and it was arranged that Sterbini, the poet who had
furnished Rossini with the "words" (as musicians say),<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
of <i>Torvaldo e Dorliska</i>, should perform a like service for<a name="page_055" id="page_055"></a>
him in connection with the <i>Barber</i>. Sterbini and Rossini
understood one another as librettist and composer always
should do; and they lived together in the same house&mdash;"the
house assigned to Luigi Zamboni," as the contract
has it&mdash;until the work was finished. The admirable
unity of the <i>Barber</i>, in which a person without previous
information on the subject could scarcely say whether
the words were written for the music or the music for
the words, may doubtless in a great measure be accounted
for by the fact that poet and musician were always together
during the composition of the opera; ready
mutually to suggest and to profit by suggestions. Nor
was it a slight advantage that the two operatic partners
were living together "in the house assigned to Luigi
Zamboni." Signor Luigi Zamboni was to take the part
of Figaro; and we may be sure that "Largo al fattotum,"
set to music as soon as it was written, was handed to
Zamboni as soon as it was composed.</p>

<p>Poet and composer had with them Beaumarchais'
comedy of the <i>Barber of Seville</i>, and Paisiello's opera
founded thereupon. Paisiello's opera was already
known to Rossini, but he does not seem to have been
quite familiar with Beaumarchais' comedy. Sterbini
read it to him from beginning to end, and it was then
decided what in Beaumarchais' comedy should be
adopted&mdash;the principal dramatic scenes had of course
to be taken&mdash;and what in Paisiello's libretto should be
rejected. The queer incidental scenes for La Jeunesse
who does nothing but sneeze, and L'Eveillé who does
nothing but yawn, were cut out; and the work was
so divided as to give Rossini the opportunity of<a name="page_056" id="page_056"></a>
composing a far greater number of musical pieces than
are to be found in Paisiello's work. In dialogue scenes
where Paisiello had contented himself with making
the interlocutory personages exchange long passages of
recitative, Rossini allowed the characters on the stage to
declaim, but supported their declamation, not by a succession
of chords, but by brilliant themes for the
orchestra. No such thoroughly musical opera had before
been composed. The series of melodies was almost
continuous, and the characters on the stage only ceased
to sing for tuneful strains to be executed by the instrumentalists.
This transfer of the current of melody
from the voices to the instruments was new in Italy;
but brilliant examples of it are of course to be found
in Mozart's operas which were performed for the first
time in Italy, just before Rossini's <i>Barber of Seville</i>.
Sterbini was a most accommodating poet. He was
quite prepared to carry out the composer's ideas, and
did not object to alter, curtail or add to his verses
with a view to increasing the effectiveness of Rossini's
music. After writing "Largo al fattotum," with
the rapidity of an improvisator he handed the verses
to Rossini, remarking&mdash;as Leopold II. remarked to
Mozart with regard to the number of notes contained
in the <i>Seraglio</i>&mdash;that there were "too many." "Precisely
the right number," was virtually Rossini's
reply; and inspired by their vivacity and their
rhythmical flow, he, in fact, set them all. Something
of the light-hearted elastic character of the constantly
changing air must doubtless be attributed, not only to
the verve with which Sterbini had written the words,<a name="page_057" id="page_057"></a>
but also to the impulsiveness and volubility with which
Rossini knew beforehand that Zamboni would sing
them.</p>

<p>Rossini worked so quickly that at times he found
himself ahead of his poet&mdash;though, as regards the mere
putting down on paper, the writing of verses is but
trifling labour compared to that of composing music.
Thus, without waiting for verses, he found a melody or
devised a form for the next musical piece in the order
agreed upon, and thereupon asked the obliging Sterbini to
furnish him with suitable "words." Besides a leading
singer in the next room, the poet and composer had by
their side a number of copyists, to whom Rossini threw
the sheets of music as he finished them. For thirteen
days the joint authors had scarcely time to eat, and M.
Azevedo asserts that they slept but little, and then only
on a sofa, when it so happened that they could no longer
keep their eyes open. For thirteen days Rossini did
not shave; and when some one observed how strange
it was that the <i>Barber</i> should have caused him to let
his beard grow, he replied, that if he had shaved he
should have gone out, and that if he had gone out he
should not have returned as soon as he ought to have
done. It seems incredible that in thirteen days the
whole of the <i>Barber</i> should have been composed in score;
but it is certain that the contract binding Rossini to
compose it was only signed on the 26th December,
and that he directed the first, second, and third performances
of <i>Torvaldo e Dorliska</i> on the 27th, 28th and 29th.
Some days, too, were lost in discussing various subjects
for the proposed opera with the Roman censorship; and<a name="page_058" id="page_058"></a>
finally, when the <i>Barber of Seville</i> had been decided
upon, Rossini had to read the comedy and to compare it
with the libretto of Paisiello's opera, and to arrange
with his own librettist a new distribution of scenes.
The date of the first representation had been fixed for
February 5th, and it was customary at the Italian
theatres to allow fifteen days for rehearsals. He must
then have finished the work in less than a month&mdash;between
December 29th and January 24th; and one
month is the time given by M. Castil-Blaze in his
<i>Histoire du Théâtre Italien</i>. Stendhal, however, says
(after Carpani) that the <i>Barber</i> was composed in thirteen
days; and this statement is repeated&mdash;not, it must
be presumed without verification&mdash;by M. Azevedo.</p>

<p>On one point connected with the production of the
new <i>Barber</i>, Stendhal and Azevedo are quite at variance.
According to the former, Rossini, as a matter of politeness,
went through the unnecessary form of asking
Paisiello's leave to reset the work, and received from
him full permission to do so; the ancient master
nourishing the hope that in recomposing a work which
had already, as he believed, received its permanent
musical form, the young composer would bring himself
to grief. M. Azevedo denies that Rossini asked
Paisiello's consent in the matter. But he adds that
the venerable maestro knew of Rossini's intention, and
not only looked forward to the failure of his youthful
rival, but was even prepared to lend a helping hand
thereto.<a name="page_059" id="page_059"></a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br /><br />
<small>IL BARBIERE.</small></h2>

<p>R<small>OSSINI</small> did not bring out his <i>Barber</i> without addressing
a few words of explanation, if not of apology, to
the public; and by way of disclaiming all idea of entering
into rivalry with Paisiello he announced his opera
under a new title.</p>

<p>"Beaumarchais' comedy," he wrote, in an advertisement
to the public, "entitled the <i>Barber of Seville; or,
The Useless Precaution</i>,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> is presented at Rome in the form
of a comic drama, under the title of <i>Almaviva; or, The
Useless Precaution</i>, in order that the public may be
fully convinced of the sentiments of respect and veneration
by which the author of the music of this drama
is animated with regard to the celebrated Paisiello, who
has already treated the subject under its primitive title.</p>

<p>"Himself invited to undertake this difficult task, the
maestro, Gioachino Rossini, in order to avoid the reproach
of entering into rivalry with the immortal author who
preceded him, expressly required that the <i>Barber of
Seville</i> should be entirely versified anew, and also that
new situations should be added for the musical pieces,<a name="page_060" id="page_060"></a>
which, moreover, are required by the modern theatrical
taste&mdash;entirely changed since the time when the renowned
Paisiello wrote his work.</p>

<p>"Certain other differences between the arrangement
of the present drama and that of the French comedy
above-cited were produced by the necessity of introducing
choruses, both for conformity with modern usage,
and because they are indispensable for musical effect in
so vast a theatre. The courteous public is informed of
this beforehand, that it may also excuse the author of
the new drama who, unless obliged by these imperious
circumstances, would never have ventured to introduce
the least change into the French work, already consecrated
by the applause of all the theatres in Europe."</p>

<p>When, in the above announcement, Rossini speaks of
"new situations for the musical pieces which are required
by the modern theatrical taste, entirely changed since
the time of Paisiello;" and again of the necessity of
introducing choruses, "both for conformity with modern
usage and because they are indispensable for musical
effect in so vast a theatre," he describes changes which he
himself introduced. The "modern theatrical taste" of
Rossini's time was the taste he had himself created. That
Paisiello's forms, and especially his formlessness (as in
long scenes of recitative) were already considered old
and were indeed obsolete, though his <i>Barber</i> had only
been thirty-five years before the public, was implied
rather pointedly in the sub-title of Sterbini's libretto,
which was described as follows: "Comedy by Beaumarchais,
newly versified throughout, and arranged for
the use of the modern Italian Musical Theatre."<a name="page_061" id="page_061"></a></p>

<p>Paisiello's <i>Barber</i> had decidedly grown old. But as
it was no longer played, people, by reason of its ancient
reputation, continued to hold it in esteem; and the
Roman public considered it very audacious for a young
composer like Rossini to have ventured into competition
with so illustrious a master. The young librettist Sterbini
was considered quite as impertinent in his way
as his musical associate. Among the Roman public a
compact body of Paisiello's friends, with the spirit of
Paisiello in the midst of them, formed a dangerous clique
of enemies; and so determined was the opposition that
Rossini had to meet on the occasion of his work being
represented for the first time that the overture&mdash;an
original work composed expressly for <i>Il Barbiere</i>, and
not the overture to <i>Aureliano</i> and to <i>Elisabetta</i> afterwards
substituted for it&mdash;was executed in the midst of
a general murmuring; "such," remarks Zanolini, "as is
heard on the approach of a procession."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>According to M. Azevedo the original overture was
lost through the carelessness of a copyist; but the
work could scarcely thus have disappeared unless not
only the score, but also the band parts, had vanished.
Stendhal says that the overture at the first representation
was that of <i>Aureliano in Palmira</i>&mdash;the one performed
even to the present day. He adds that the
audience recognised, or fancied it recognised, in the
overture the grumbling of the old guardian and the
lively remonstrances of his interesting ward. However
that may have been the overture was scarcely listened<a name="page_062" id="page_062"></a>
to; nor did the introduction meet with any better fate,
nor, indeed, could even the appearance of Garcia on the
stage dispose the public in favour of the new work.</p>

<p>Garcia, the most famous tenor of his time, was of
course the Almaviva of the evening. It has already
been seen that Luigi Zamboni, Rossini's fellow-lodger
during the composition of the work, was the original
Figaro. The Don Basilio was Vitarelli; Bartolo,
Botticelli. The part of Rosina was assigned to Mme.
Giorgi-Righetti, who has left a very interesting
account of the first representation of the opera.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The composer had been weak enough, says the <i>prima
donna</i> of this historical evening, "to allow Garcia to
sing beneath Rosina's balcony a Spanish melody of his
own arrangement." Garcia held that as the scene was
laid in Spain, and as Count Almaviva was a Spaniard
nothing could be more appropriate than that this interesting
personage should address the lady of his heart
in Spanish song. Unfortunately he forgot to tune his
guitar, and this indispensable preliminary operation
had to be performed by Rosina's serenader on the stage.
The public began to laugh; then a string broke, and the
public began to hiss. When the broken string had been
replaced, and the air so awkwardly prefaced was at
length heard, the public did not like it and only
listened to it enough to be able to reproduce certain
passages of it in burlesque tones. The introduction to
Figaro's air, which, as every opera-goer knows, is,
before being sung by the vocalist, played by the
orchestra, attracted, as well it might do, a certain<a name="page_063" id="page_063"></a>
amount of attention. When, however, Zamboni
entered with another guitar, the anti-guitarists set
up a loud laugh, and without waiting to see whether
the baritone, unlike the tenor, had taken the trouble
to tune his instrument beforehand, hissed and hooted
so that not a note of "Largo al Fattotum" was
heard. When Mme. Giorgi-Righetti made her appearance
in the balcony, she was, in her character
of favourite singer, applauded; but having no air assigned
to her in this not very suitable situation, the
audience thought they were being robbed of the expected
<i>cavatina</i>, and uttered murmurs of disapprobation. The
brilliant and melodious duet for Almaviva and Figaro
was sung in the midst of hisses and derisive shouts.
When, however, Rosina reappeared and sang the first
notes of "Una voce" the audience became silent; a
chance was given to the composer for the sake of the
singer. Mme. Giorgi-Righetti was radiant with youth
and beauty; the effect of her fresh, beautiful voice
was too much for the opposition. The conclusion of her
bright, sparkling air was followed by three long rounds of
applause. Rossini bowed from his place, at the head
of the orchestra, to the public, and then turning towards
the singer, whispered, "<i>Oh natura</i>!"</p>

<p>Vitarelli, the representative of Don Basilio, had
"made up" admirably for the part; and his entry would
possibly have been effective but that a trap having been
left open on the stage he stumbled over it, fell, damaged
his face, and on rising had to begin his admirable dramatic
air on the efficacy of calumny with his handkerchief
to his nose. A portion of the public is said<a name="page_064" id="page_064"></a>
to have imagined that the fall, the injuries to the
face, the handkerchief to the nose, were all in the
business of the part, and thinking it savoured of buffoonery,
expressed their disapproval accordingly. The
duet of the letter was objected to by reason of certain
incidents afterwards left out; but the music must have
been liked for its own sake had it only been heard.
As if the untuned guitar, the broken string, the newly-placed
cavatina, the open trap, the fall of Don Basilio,
and the necessity under which Rosina's music-master
found himself of singing "La Calunnia" with a handkerchief
in front of his mouth had not been enough, the
opening of the finest concerted finale which had yet been
given to the Italian stage was the signal for the appearance
of a cat, which was chased in one direction by
Figaro, in another by Bartholo, and which, in a wild endeavour
to escape from an attack made upon it by
Basilio, ran into the skirt of Rosina's dress. The self-introduction
of the cat among the principal characters,
grouped together for the finely built concerted piece
which brings the first act to an end, disarranged as a
matter of course all the master's combinations. During
the performance of the opening movement the
attention of the public was concentrated entirely on the
cat, and general laughter went on increasing until the
long, elaborate, constantly varied, and, on all other occasions,
highly interesting finale was brought to an end.</p>

<p>With something like a just appreciation of his own
merit and with profound contempt for the injustice
and insolence of the public, Rossini, on the fall of the
curtain, turned round and applauded. He was the only<a name="page_065" id="page_065"></a>
person in the theatre who did so; and the audience
indignant at the presumption of this interested minority
of one, was at the same time so astonished that it forgot
at the time to manifest its resentment.</p>

<p>The moment of vengeance arrived when the curtain
rose for the second act. The public showed what it
thought of Rossini's having ventured to show what
he thought of his own music, by hissing and hooting
in such a manner that not a note of the second
act was heard. The composer, while this organised
noise was being kept up, remained perfectly calm at
the orchestral piano. At the end of the performance
he went home to bed; and when the principal singers
called upon him soon afterwards to condole with him
he was fast asleep.</p>

<p>The only change that Rossini next day found it necessary
to make in his work was to substitute a new air
for the unfortunate Spanish song which Garcia had
been allowed to introduce. This gave him no trouble.
He simply transcribed for the solo voice the melody of
the celebrated chorus which had already figured first in
<i>Ciro in Babilonia</i>, and afterwards in <i>Aureliano in
Palmira</i>. Such was the origin of the beautiful "Ecco
ridente il cielo" which he handed to Garcia as he wrote
it, and which was sung the same evening. Those who
believe in the absolute significance of music apart from
words, may be interested to hear that Almaviva's
charming love song was, as first composed, a prayer&mdash;as
a love song after all may well be.</p>

<p>At the second representation the <i>Barber</i> was comparatively
well received. Being heard, it was naturally<a name="page_066" id="page_066"></a>
admired. Indeed, a certain number of connoisseurs
are said to have appreciated it from the very first,
though on the opening night the difficulty must have
been not to understand the work&mdash;which appeals alike
to the simplest, and to the most cultivated, musical
intelligence&mdash;but merely to hear it. After a few performances
Rossini's new work began to excite enthusiasm;
and it had not been before the public for more
than a week when it was received nightly with frantic
applause.</p>

<p>Garcia's Spanish melody was, after some years, reintroduced
into the <i>Barber</i> by Rubini; the trio which, in
the music lesson scene, occupied the place now filled
by no matter what fancy air that the Rosina of the
evening thinks fit to introduce, is known to have been
lost: and it has been seen that, according to some authorities,
a like fate attended the overture written specially
for the work. Stendhal, on the unacknowledged authority
of Carpani, states that at the first representation the
opera was preceded by the overture to <i>Aureliano in
Palmira</i> and to <i>Elisabetta</i>, which, though heard in connection
with the former work at Milan and in connection
with the latter at Naples, had never been heard
at Rome. Besides borrowing from himself, Rossini, in
more than one "number" of the <i>Barber of Seville</i>, was
indebted to the invention of others. The melody of the
trio "Zitti zitti" is taken, note for note, from Simon's
air in Haydn's <i>Seasons</i>&mdash;a work, it will be remembered,
of which Rossini in his early youth had directed the
performance at the Lyceum of Bologna. The very
lively tune sung by the Duenna Berta is adapted without<a name="page_067" id="page_067"></a>
much alteration from a Russian dance, which Rossini
had heard played by a Russian lady of his acquaintance.
It soon became the custom not to listen to
Berta's air, which is always assigned to an inferior
singer; and it acquired the name of the "Ice tune;"
not in allusion to its place of origin, but because, during
its performance, the people in the boxes called for ices.
The part of Rosina, which in the present day is usually
given to the soprano, was composed for the mezzo-soprano
voice. Mme. Giorgi-Righetti sang it, of course,
in its original key; that of F. Many a soprano has
sung it in G. According to an account given by M.
Castil-Blaze in his <i>Histoire du Théâtre Italien</i> of the
different keys in which the principal airs of <i>Il Barbiere</i>
have been sung, Figaro's "Largo al fattotum," written
for Zamboni in the key of C, is generally sung in B flat;
Tamburini, however, sang it in B natural. Basilio's
"La calunnia," written in D, is for the most part sung
in C. Lablache used to sing in D flat the air for
Bartholo, written in E flat.</p>

<p>Whatever may be said as to the character belonging
absolutely to this or that key, it would be difficult to
allow that the music of Rosina, of Figaro, of Basilio, or
of Bartolo has either lost or gained by these frequent
transpositions.<a name="page_068" id="page_068"></a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br /><br />
<small>ROSSINI AND THE COMIC IN MUSIC.</small></h2>

<p>N<small>O</small> composer has written more lively, more graceful
comedy music than Rossini. But, except <i>Il Figlio per
Azzardo</i>, with its high notes for low voices, its low
voices for high notes, its ludicrous accompaniments,
and its grotesque instruments of percussion in the
shape of metal lamp-shades tapped with violin bows,
Rossini never wrote music which, comic or serious,
was not charming; and <i>Il Figlio per Azzardo</i> was nothing
but a practical joke played for the benefit of an
unreasonable and impolite manager. It may be interesting
to consider in what the musical comic really
consists.</p>

<p>The æsthetics of music have been much neglected;
and no one, so far as I know, has yet attempted to explain
or even to define the comic in music. Everything,
it may be roughly said, is comic that makes one laugh;
and if this be the case, then, between comic music and
music so utterly bad as to be ludicrous and absurd,
there should be no great difference. The intention,
however, of the composer must count for something,
and one cannot accept as comic music which is simply
played or sung very much out of tune. Many
persons disbelieve altogether in comic music. Lively,
brilliant music is admirable, and commends itself to<a name="page_069" id="page_069"></a>
every taste. But comic music is for the most part
as objectionable as comic women, than which nothing
much more objectionable can well be imagined. It is
the province of music to charm, to fascinate, to call up
visions of delight, but not to cause fits of laughter. It
may be questioned, moreover, whether laughter, or even
the least tendency to laugh, can be provoked by music,
so long as it is composed and executed according to the
rules of art. A comic poem, a comic picture, may be
a masterpiece of artistic expression, but it is difficult
to imagine a perfect musical composition which would
afford matter for merriment. Gounod's <i>Funeral March
for a Marionette</i> is a graceful, melodious piece of music,
in which there is nothing comic but the title. No one
would find it in the slightest degree amusing but for the
description of the incidents it is supposed to illustrate,
which is usually printed in the programmes of concerts
where the said funeral march is to be performed. In
the old-fashioned Italian operas of the buffo type there
are plenty of chattering songs in which the humour,
such as it is, consists in the words being uttered so
rapidly that any greater rapidity of utterance would
seem to be impossible. Here some little amusement
may be caused by witnessing the efforts of the buffo
singer or singers&mdash;for there are often two or three of
them chattering at once&mdash;to overcome such difficulties
as have been deliberately put forward for that purpose
by the composer. If this, however, be humour, it is
humour of a very mean order, on a par with that of
"Peter Piper pecked a peck of pepper," and other
verbal devices for testing the power of a speaker to<a name="page_070" id="page_070"></a>
speak rapidly and at the same time distinctly. In
Paisiello's <i>Barber of Seville</i> there was a comic piece for
two fantastic and quite episodical characters, borrowed
from Beaumarchais' comedy (where, as already mentioned,
Rossini took good care to leave them), of whom
one, La Jeunesse, sneezed, while the other, L'Eveillé,
yawned, in the presence of old Bartolo. It may be very
funny to sneeze and to yawn, but such fun as therein
lies can scarcely be said to be of a musical character.</p>

<p>Much, indeed, that is considered comic in music
possesses the same sort of drollery that belongs in comic
writing to grammatical errors, or to mistakes in spelling.
Romberg's <i>Toy Symphony</i>, in which, with the usual
orchestral basis, solo instruments of a burlesque character,
such as the rattle, the penny trumpet, the child's
drum, and so on, are from time to time introduced, is
surprisingly funny. But with the first feeling of surprise
the fun also vanishes; for the humour in this, as
in all other toy symphonies, consists only in giving
good music to bad instruments. If Romberg's symphony
were played throughout with instruments of the
best make in the parts written for the "toys," no one
not previously acquainted with the work would imagine
for a moment that it was intended to be amusing. In
Mozart's <i>Musical Joke</i>, again, the joke consists in
the instruments coming in at wrong places, executing
inappropriate phrases, and playing out of tune. There
are elements of beauty in the work, as in everything
that Mozart composed; but the humour of the piece
is akin to that of those American humourists of whom
one of the most remarkable was not ashamed to complain<a name="page_071" id="page_071"></a>
of "Mr. Chaucer" that he could not spell. A composer
may easily produce a laugh if he will only condescend
to an absurdity so easy to realise, by causing a pretentious
introduction to be followed by a trivial tune; or
he may produce a genuine burlesque effect by imitating
with characteristic exaggeration the style of some other
composer; or he may show a certain wit by means of
musical allusions, as Mozart has done in the supper
scene of <i>Don Giovanni</i>, where Don Juan's private band
is made to play "Non più andrai," in order that
Leporello may refer to the fact of its not having been
quite appreciated when it was first heard. But without
Leporello's spoken (or declaimed) words it would occur
to no one that there was anything amusing in
introducing into one opera an air from another.</p>

<p>Of the music suitable to comedy Rossini was undoubtedly
a master; and in such music the <i>Barber of
Seville</i> abounds. But though the most characteristic air
in the whole opera, Figaro's "Largo al fattotum," is
bright, gay, joyful, impulsive, one cannot say that it is
comic. Heard for the first time apart from the words,
it would cause no one to laugh, nor even, except as
the expression of musical satisfaction, to smile.</p>

<p>Rossini could write very comic music indeed when
he pleased. He knew well enough, however, that he
was writing bad music at the time. He launched into
all sorts of extravagances, and introduced some effects
in which, as we have already seen, musical instruments,
properly so called, had no part.</p>

<p>Meyerbeer, in his highly but sometimes almost grotesque
orchestral effects, has approached the very verge of<a name="page_072" id="page_072"></a>
burlesque music such as Rossini, in the little opera referred
to, deliberately wrote. The simple motive, for
instance, of the march in <i>Robert le Diable</i> is given, when
introduced for the first time, to four kettledrums. A
four-note melody executed on four kettledrums would
in a burlesque have excited roars of laughter. Jessica
was "never merry when she heard sweet music." But
sweet music is one thing, and grotesque music another.
It is easier, indeed, to speak of comic music than to
define it accurately, or to cite specimens that will bear
analysis.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.<br /><br />
<small>FROM "OTELLO" TO "SEMIRAMIDE."</small></h2>

<p>I<small>N</small> 1816, Rossini brought out at the San Carlo, of
Naples, the second of his serious operas, or at least the
second of those which were destined to make a mark:
<i>Otello</i>. This work exhibited reforms of various kinds
much more important than any that are to be noticed in
<i>Tancredi</i>. Recitative is more sparingly used than in the
earlier work, and for the first time it is accompanied by
the full band. Now, too, Rossini banished the piano from
the orchestra, where it had been allowed to remain long
after its expulsion as an orchestral instrument from
the bands of Germany and (thanks to Gluck) of
France. Two years after its production at Naples
Byron witnessed a representation of <i>Otello</i> at Venice,<a name="page_073" id="page_073"></a>
and gives some account of it in one of his letters dated
1818. The libretto struck him as bad and ridiculous,
but he praises the music, and the style in which it was
executed. Lord Mount-Edgcumbe, when the work was
given in London, must have been disgusted to find two
of the leading parts assigned to bass voices. Iago
is of necessity almost as important a character as
Othello himself. Rossini's librettist kept him, nevertheless,
a little too much in the back ground, while Roderigo,
on the other hand, is too much brought forward. In expelling
the piano from the orchestra Rossini at the
same time, did away with those interminable recitatives
accompanied by piano or piano and double bass
which separated the musical pieces in the works composed
by Rossini's predecessors. It was the impersonation,
however, of <i>Otello</i> by Davide, which, in the way of
acting and singing, helped more than anything else
to ensure the success of the performance.</p>

<p>"Davide," wrote a French critic, M. Bertin, from
Venice, in 1823, "excites among the <i>dilettanti</i> of this
town an enthusiasm and delight which could scarcely
be conceived without having been witnessed. He is a
singer of the new school, full of mannerism, affectation
and display, abusing, like Martin, his magnificent
voice with its prodigious compass (three octaves
comprised between four B flats). He crushes the principal
motive of an air beneath the luxuriance of his
ornamentation, which has no other merit than that
of difficulty conquered. But he is also a singer of
warmth, <i>verve</i>, expression, energy and musical sentiment;
alone he can fill up and give life to a scene;<a name="page_074" id="page_074"></a>
it is impossible for another singer to carry away an
audience as he does, and when he will only be simple
he is admirable; he is the Rossini of song, he is a
great singer, the greatest I have ever heard. Doubtless
the manner in which Garcia plays and sings the part of
Otello is preferable, taking it altogether, to that of
Davide. It is purer, more severe, more constantly
dramatic; but with all his faults Davide produces more
effect&mdash;a great deal more effect. There is something in
him, I cannot say what, which, even when he is ridiculous,
commands, enhances attention. He never
leaves you cold, and when he does not move you he
astonishes you; in a word, before hearing him, I did
not know what the power of singing really was. The
enthusiasm he excites is without limits. In fact his
faults are not faults, for Italians who in their <i>opera
seria</i> do not employ what the French call the tragic
style, scarcely understand us when we tell them that
a waltz or a quadrille movement is out of place in
the mouth of a Cæsar, an Assur, or an Otello. With them
the essential thing is to please; they are only difficult
on this point, and their indifference as to all the rest
is really inconceivable. Here is an example of it.
Davide, considering, apparently, that the final duet of
<i>Otello</i> did not sufficiently show off his voice, determined
to substitute for it a duet from <i>Armida</i> ('Amor possente
nome') which is very pretty, but anything rather than
severe. As it was impossible to kill Desdemona to such
a tune, the Moor, after giving way to the most violent
jealousy, sheaths his dagger, and begins in the most
tender and graceful manner his duet with Desdemona,<a name="page_075" id="page_075"></a>
at the conclusion of which he takes her politely by the
hand, and retires amidst the applause and bravos of
the public, who seems to think it quite natural that
the piece should finish in this manner, or rather that
it should not finish at all; for after this beautiful
<i>dénouement</i> the action is about as far advanced as it
was in the first scene. We do not in France carry
our love of music so far as to tolerate such absurdities
as these, and perhaps we are right."</p>

<p><i>Otello</i> in the present day seems somewhat antiquated,
and in some of the dramatic scenes the accent of
passion is smothered beneath roulades and vocalistic
ornaments of all kinds. But it contains some fine
pieces, and the last act is full of beauty. Speaking
once to a friend on the subject of his own operas,
Rossini said that much of what he had written must in
time pass out of fashion, but that he believed the
second act of <i>William Tell</i>, the last act of <i>Otello</i>, and
the whole of the <i>Barber of Seville</i> would survive the rest.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
<i>Il Barbiere</i> is, indeed, as fresh now as when it was first
written. Yet Paisiello's treatment of the same subject
was found to be old-fashioned in a very few years&mdash;was
in fact rendered so by the newness, the brightness,
the youthful gaiety of Rossini's setting.</p>

<p>Nothing more need be said in this volume of Rossini
considered as a composer of comic opera. He
cultivated every style, including the ancient style of <i>La
Cenerentola</i> which contains much comic with some serious
music, and of <i>La Gazza Ladra</i>, which might well have<a name="page_076" id="page_076"></a>
been treated seriously throughout, though in some of
the gravest situations of this work he is gay, in some
of the severest, lively.</p>

<p><i>La Cenerentola</i>, like <i>Il Barbiere</i>, <i>La Gazza Ladra</i>, and
so many successful operas by Rossini and other Italian
composers (<i>L'Elisir</i>, <i>Linda</i>, <i>Lucrezia</i>, <i>La Favorita</i>, <i>Maria
di Rohan</i>, for instance, of Donizetti, and the <i>Sonnambula</i>
and <i>Norma</i> of Bellini), is based on a French play&mdash;the
ingenious comedy of <i>Cendrillon</i>, by Etienne. Rossini
composed it for the Teatro Valle of Rome, where it was
produced for the carnival of 1817, on the 26th of
December, 1816, precisely one year after <i>Torvaldo e
Dorliska</i>, nearly one year after the <i>Barber</i>, a few months
after <i>Otello</i>, and a few months before <i>La Gazza Ladra</i>.
Between the winter of 1815 and the spring of 1816,
Rossini composed and produced six operas, including
the four admirable ones just named. The two others
given with comparatively little success were <i>Torvaldo e
Dorliska</i> and <i>La Gazzetta</i>.</p>

<p><i>La Cenerentola</i>, on its first production, excited no such
enthusiasm as <i>Il Barbiere</i>, but drew after its second or
third representation. It is known to have been Rossini's
custom when an opera of his fell, to pick up the
pieces; and the score of <i>La Cenerentola</i> was adorned
throughout with fragments saved from the ruins of
his earlier works; such as the wholly forgotten <i>Pietra
del Paragone</i> and the never-much-remembered <i>Turco in
Italia</i>. To the former had originally belonged the drinking
chorus, the burlesque proclamation of the Baron,
and the duet "Un soave non so chè;" to the latter the duet
"Zitti zitti," the sestet and the stretta of the finale.<a name="page_077" id="page_077"></a></p>

<p>To <i>La Cenerentola</i> belongs the most beautiful and the
most striking of Rossini's final airs for the prima donna:
the once highly popular "Non più mesta." This was his
fourth air of the kind; and he now abandoned this
method of bringing an opera to a brilliant termination in
favour of other composers&mdash;who duly adopted it.</p>

<p>The part of Cenerentola, like that of Rosina, was written
for Madame Giorgi-Righetti, who obtained therein the
most brilliant success, especially in the famous <i>rondo
finale</i>. All Rossini's great prima-donna parts were composed
for the contralto or for the mezzo-soprano voice;
for Madame Marcolini, Tancredi; for Madame Giorgi-Righetti,
Rosina and Cenerentola; and for Mademoiselle
Colbran, Desdemona and Semiramide. When Rossini
began his career, so absurd was the prevalent custom of
distributing the parts that the first woman's part was
habitually given to the contralto, the first man's part to
the sopranist, or artificial male soprano. Rossini continued
to compose principal female parts, first for the
contralto, then for the mezzo-soprano voice; and it was
only when he produced <i>Matilda di Shubrun</i> towards the
end of his Italian career (1821) that he assigned a
leading character to a soprano. Matilda in <i>Matilda di
Shubrun</i>, and Matilde in <i>Guillaume Tell</i>, are the only
two parts that Rossini ever wrote for the soprano voice.</p>

<p>Whether soprano voices have been forced into activity
in order to suit new tastes, or whether composers have
taken to writing for the soprano voice because in the
present day sopranos, and especially "light sopranos,"
abound, whereas good mezzo-soprano and contralto voices
are but rarely to be met with, it would be difficult to say.<a name="page_078" id="page_078"></a>
But with the exception of Meyerbeer's <i>Africaine</i> and
Donizetti's <i>Favorita</i>, no leading operatic part has for the
last fifty years or more been written for the contralto
voice.</p>

<p>A new kind of part, however, has been found for the
most masculine of feminine voices; such parts as those
of Pippo in <i>La Gazza Ladra</i>, of Malcolm Græme in <i>La
Donna del Lago</i>, and of Arsace in <i>Semiramide</i>; and here
again we see an innovation of Rossini's, which by his
successors has been generally adopted.</p>

<p>In connection with <i>La Gazza Ladra</i> a few words may
here be said of Rossini's orchestration; much more varied,
more brilliant and more sonorous than that of his predecessors.
Rossini introduced new instruments, and with
them new instrumental combinations. These innovations,
like those consisting in a new distribution of the voice
parts, and in the substitution of orchestral melodies with
declamatory phrases here and there for the singers in
lieu of endless recitative accompanied by chords for the
violoncello and piano, excited the hostility of many
orthodox professors, together with old-fashioned connoisseurs
and amateurs of all kinds. They accused Rossini
of bringing clarinets from cowherds, horns from the
hunting field, trumpets from the camp, and trombones
from the infernal regions. He was destined, on establishing
himself at Paris, to introduce cornets, ophicleides,
and, in the overture to <i>William Tell</i>, the nearest
possible approach to the instrument with which the
cowherds of Switzerland do really appeal to the animals
placed under their care. But before he had reached
these extremes, before he had in <i>Semiramide</i> brought an<a name="page_079" id="page_079"></a>
entire military band on to the stage, and had in the
same opera written for four horns a beautiful and beautifully
harmonised melody which does not in any way
suggest the chase, he raised the mortal anger of one of
his adversaries and actually placed his life in danger by
beginning the overture to <i>La Gazza Ladra</i> with a duet
for drums. A young enthusiast on the side of stagnation
went about armed with the proclaimed intention of
slaying the ruthless innovator. Rossini sent for the
juvenile fanatic, talked to him, explained that in a
piece of a military character drums were not altogether
out of place and at last succeeded in appeasing his fury.</p>

<p>To appreciate at a glance Rossini's importance as a
writer for the orchestra it is only necessary to recall
the fact that he alone of Italian composers has composed
overtures which live with a life of their own apart from
the works to which they belong, and that of such overtures
he has left five; those of the <i>Barber</i>, of <i>La Gazza
Ladra</i>, of <i>Semiramide</i>, of the <i>Siege of Corinth</i>, and of
<i>William Tell</i>.</p>

<small>ROSSINI ON HIS TRAVELS.</small></h2>

<p>W<small>HEN</small> in 1823, the year of <i>Semiramide's</i> being produced
at Venice, Rossini started with his wife, the former
Mdlle. Colbran, for Paris&mdash;whence he made his way to
London, returning to Paris soon afterwards&mdash;he enjoyed<a name="page_080" id="page_080"></a>
a world-wide reputation, but was far from being rich.
Thanks, however, to a season in London, and to five
years' residence in Paris, where lucrative posts were
given to him, he soon made his fortune.</p>

<p>Speaking some thirty years afterwards of his visit to
London, Rossini said to Hiller:<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> "'From the beginning
I had an opportunity of observing how disproportionately
singers were paid in comparison with
composers. If the composer got fifty ducats, the singer
received a thousand. Italian operatic composers might
formerly write heaven knows how many operas, and yet
only be able to exist miserably. Things hardly went
otherwise with myself until my appointment under
Barbaja.'</p>

<p>"'<i>Tancredi</i> was your first opera which really made
a great hit, maestro; how much did you get for it?'</p>

<p>"'Five hundred francs,' replied Rossini, 'and when I
wrote my last Italian opera, <i>Semiramide</i>, and stipulated
for 5,000 francs, I was looked upon, not by the impresario
alone, but by the entire public, as a kind of
pickpocket.'</p>

<p>"'You have the consolation of knowing,' said Hiller,
'that singers, managers, and publishers, have been
enriched by your means.'</p>

<p>"'A fine consolation' replied Rossini. 'Except
during my stay in England, I never gained sufficient
by my art to enable me to put by anything; and even
in London I did not get money as a composer, but as
an accompanist.'<a name="page_081" id="page_081"></a></p>

<p>"'But still,' observed Hiller,'that was because you
were a celebrated composer.'</p>

<p>"'That is what my friends said,' replied Rossini, 'to
decide me to do it. It may have been prejudice, but I
had a kind of repugnance to being paid for accompanying
on the piano, and I have only done so in London.
However, people wanted to see the tip of my nose, and
to hear my wife. I had fixed for our co-operation at
musical soirées the tolerably high price of 50<i>l.</i> We
attended somewhere about sixty such soirées, and that
was after all worth having. In London, too, musicians
will do anything to get money, and some delicious facts
came under my observation there. For instance, the
first time that I undertook the task of accompanist at
a soirée of this description, I was informed that Puzzi,
the celebrated horn-player, and Dragonetti, the more celebrated
contrabassist, would also be present. I thought
they would perform solos; not a bit of it! They
were to assist me in accompanying. "Have you then
your parts to accompany these pieces?" I asked them.
"Not we," was their answer, "but we get well paid,
and we accompany as we think fit!"</p>

<p>'"These extemporaneous attempts at instrumentation
struck me as rather dangerous, and I therefore begged
Dragonetti to content himself with giving a few pizzicatos
when I winked at him, and Puzzi to strengthen
the final cadenzas with a few notes, which, being
a good musician, he easily invented for the occasion.
In this manner things went off without any very
disastrous results, and every one was pleased.'"</p>

<p>"'Delicious!' exclaimed Hiller, 'still it strikes me<a name="page_082" id="page_082"></a>
that the English have made great progress in a musical
point of view. At the present time a great deal of
good music is performed in London&mdash;it is well performed
and listened to attentively, that is to say, at public concerts.
In private drawing-rooms music still plays a
sorry part, and a great number of individuals, totally
devoid of talent, give themselves airs of incredible
assurance, and impart instruction on subjects of which
their knowledge amounts almost to nothing.'</p>

<p>"'I knew in London a certain professor who had
amassed a large fortune as a teacher of singing and the
pianoforte,' said Rossini, 'while all he understood was
to play a little, most wretchedly, on the flute. There was
another man, with an immense connection, who did not
even know the notes. He employed an accompanist to
beat into his head the pieces he afterwards taught, and
to accompany him in his lessons; but he had a good
voice.'"</p>

<p>Many of the French composers, with about an equal proportion
of critics, received Rossini with anything but
cordiality. He was chiefly condemned as a seeker after
new effects. But Berlioz some years later vituperated
him from quite another point of view. He found his
music heartless, unemotional, and written entirely for the
singer, and for the sake of vocal, to the disregard of
dramatic effect. "If," he afterwards said, "it had been
in my power to place a barrel of powder under the
Salle Louvois and blow it up during the representation
of <i>La Gazza Ladra</i> or <i>Il Barbiere</i>, with all that it contained,
I certainly should not have failed to do so."</p>

<p>The composer Bertin, less a contemporary than a<a name="page_083" id="page_083"></a>
predecessor of Rossini, wrote of him in the following
terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>"M. Rossini has a brilliant imagination, <i>verve</i>,
originality, great fecundity; but he knows that he
is not always pure and correct; and, whatever certain
persons may say, purity of style is not to be disdained,
and faults of syntax are never excusable. Besides,
since the writers of our daily journals constitute themselves
judges in music, having qualified myself by
<i>Montano</i>, <i>Le Délire</i>, <i>Aline</i>, &amp;c., I think I have
the right to give my opinion <i>ex professo</i>. I give it
frankly, and sign it, which is not done by certain persons
who strive incognito to make and unmake reputations.
All this has been suggested only by the love of
art, and in the interest of M. Rossini himself. This
composer is beyond contradiction the most brilliant
talent that Italy has produced since Cimarosa; but one
may deserve to be called celebrated without being on an
equality with Mozart."</p>

<p>It seems afterwards to have occurred to Bertin
that music as good as Rossini's might be composed by
machinery. He declares, indeed, in a pamphlet directed
against Rossini, entitled "La musique mechanique et
de la musique philosophique," that he once asked
Maelzel, the inventor of the metronome, whether he
could construct a machine to compose music; upon which
Maelzel daringly replied that he could, but that his mechanically-made
tunes would not be up to the level of
Sacchini, Cimarosa, and Mozart, and would be worthy
only of Rossini.</p>

<p>"M. Auber has told me," says M. Jouvin, in his Life<a name="page_084" id="page_084"></a>
of that composer, "how he met Rossini for the first
time at a dinner given by Carafa in honour of his
illustrious compatriot. On rising from table the
maestro, at the request of his host, went to the piano
and sang Figaro's cavatina, 'Largo al fattotum della
cità.'</p>

<p>"'I shall never forget,' said M. Auber to me, 'the
effect produced by his lightning-like execution.' Rossini
had a beautiful baritone voice, and he sang his music
with a spirit and <i>verve</i> which neither Pellegrini nor
Galli nor Lablache approached in the same part. As for
his art as an accompanist, it was marvellous; it was
not on a key-board but on an orchestra that the vertiginous
hands of the pianist seemed to gallop. When he
had finished I looked mechanically at the ivory keys; I
fancied I could see them smoking. On arriving home
I felt much inclined to throw my scores into the fire.
'It will warm them, perhaps,' I said to myself;
'besides, what is the use of composing music, if one
cannot compose like Rossini?'"</p>

<p>Apart from a little professional jealousy, Rossini met
in Paris with the warmest possible reception; and the
men in authority gave him substantial marks of their
esteem. He was appointed director of the Théâtre des
Italiens, with a salary of 20,000 francs a year; and when
after eighteen months' service he resigned this post, the
salary was continued to him in connection with another,
of which the duties were purely nominal: that of
"Inspector of singing." In granting Rossini this
salary, the object of the government was to induce him
to remain in France, and to compose a series of works<a name="page_085" id="page_085"></a>
for the Académie where, after producing <i>Il Viaggio a
Reims</i>, at the Italian Theatre in honour of Charles
X.'s coronation, he brought out in succession <i>Le Siège de
Corinthe</i>,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> re-arranged from <i>Maometto Secundo</i>, an
opera of the year 1820; <i>Moïse</i>, re-arranged from
<i>Mosè in Egitto</i>, a Lenten opera oratorio of the year 1818;
<i>Le Comte Ory</i>, re-arranged with many additions from <i>Il
Viaggio a Reims</i>; and his greatest work <i>Guillaume Tell</i>.</p>

<p>Every one knows that after <i>William Tell</i>, Rossini
wrote no more for the stage. But every one does not
know that he for some little time afterwards entertained
an idea of composing an opera on the subject of
Faust. "Yes," answered Rossini, when Ferdinand
Hiller questioned him on the subject, "it was for a
long period a favourite notion of mine, and I had already
planned the whole scenarium with Jouy; it was naturally
based upon Goethe's poem. At this time, however
there arose in Paris a regular 'Faust' mania; every
theatre had a particular 'Faust' of its own, and this
somewhat damped my ardour. Meanwhile the revolution
of July had taken place; the Grand Opera, previously
a royal institution, passed into the hands of a
private person; my mother was dead, and my father
found life in Paris unbearable because he did not
understand French: so I cancelled the agreement which
bound me by rights to send in four other grand operas,
preferring to remain quietly in my native land, enlivening
the last years of my old father's existence. I<a name="page_086" id="page_086"></a>
had been far away from my poor mother when she expired;
this was an endless source of regret to me, and I
was most apprehensive that the same thing might occur
in my father's case."</p>

<p>Many explanations have been given of Rossini's reasons
for abstaining from writing any more for the stage, when
he had once produced <i>William Tell</i>&mdash;nor did he afterwards
compose anything whatever of importance except
his thoroughly beautiful <i>Stabat Mater</i>. Some of these
explanations have been already referred to. The truth
in this matter seems to have been that Rossini acted
under the influence of a great variety of reasons. Without
being hurt by the comparative coldness with which
<i>William Tell</i> for a time was received, without being
jealous of Meyerbeer's and of Halévy's success, which,
according to some anecdote-mongers, caused him to
exclaim: "Je reviendrai quand les Juifs auront fini
leur Sabbat," without even having "written himself out,"
he may well have reflected whether such a strain as
he had subjected himself to in composing <i>William Tell</i>
was worth undergoing a second time. With the exception
of <i>Il Viaggio a Reims</i> nothing that he wrote
for Paris, until he undertook <i>William Tell</i>, was absolutely
new. He had already lost the habit, if not the
faculty, of composing rapidly; and this same <i>Viaggio a
Reims</i> was the only original work he produced between
<i>Semiramide</i>, 1823, and <i>Guillaume Tell</i>, 1829. Writing
at Paris for as fine an orchestra as that of the San Carlo
Theatre, and for a finer chorus, he paid particular attention
to the choral and orchestral portions of his last
great work. He also profited by the fact that at the<a name="page_087" id="page_087"></a>
Académie he was free to have as many rehearsals as he
pleased; and to turn this advantage to the greatest
possible account he gave himself infinite, and with
him quite unusual pains, to secure a perfect execution of
his opera. In writing for the voices moreover, he had
completely changed his style. What indeed can be more
different from the florid and frequently insignificant,&mdash;or,
so to say, anti-significant&mdash;passages in the rich, soft,
voluptuous melodies of <i>Semiramide</i>, than the simple,
emotional, eminently dramatic strains given to the singers
in <i>Guillaume Tell</i>? Heine speaks in his "Parisian
Letters" of Meyerbeer's mother having once told him
that her son was "not obliged to compose;" on which
Heine remarks that a windmill might as well say it was
not "obliged" to go round: though a windmill will turn
if the wind blows, just as a composer will produce music
if moved by the spirit. Talking on this most interesting
subject of speculation to Ferdinand Hiller, Rossini
himself confessed that "when a man has composed
thirty-seven operas he begins to feel a little tired."
<i>Guillaume Tell</i>, in any case, marks the end of Rossini's
career as an operatic composer.</p>

<p>Opera has a distinct history in Italy, in France, and
in Germany. For a considerable time it makes progress
in Italy. Then Italian composers and Italian singers go
abroad taking Italian opera with them. German composers,
too, visit Italy, and after studying there return to
their native land, to produce with modifications operas
which must still be regarded as Italian in character. At
last the Germans who have studied in Italy become the
rivals of the Italian masters. Then Gluck and Piccinni<a name="page_088" id="page_088"></a>
contend with one another in presence of French
audiences, and above all, of French critics. Finally it
becomes the turn of the Italians to borrow from the
Germans; for Mozart, so highly indebted for his
melodic inspiration&mdash;or at least for his melodic forms&mdash;to
Italy, was so much before the Italians in regard to
the composition of his orchestra and the construction of
his musical pieces, that when Rossini wished to introduce
into Italian opera the important reforms which
must always be associated with his name, he had
nothing to do but to turn to Mozart as a model. Rossini
was the first Italian composer who accompanied recitative
with the full band, assigned leading parts to bass
singers, made of each dramatic scene one continuous
piece of music, and brought to perfection those highly
varied, amply developed concerted finales, which form so
striking a feature in modern Italian opera. All these
innovations were simply adaptations from Mozart.</p>

<p>The history of Rossini's Italian career is the history
of opera in Italy during the first half of the nineteenth
century; for Rossini caused the works of his predecessors
to be laid aside, while his own works and those of his
immediate successors, and in an artistic sense followers,
continued to be played almost to the exclusion of all
others until the Verdi period. And even Verdi, who in
his latter works has studied dramatic consistency and
dramatic effect more than Rossini studied them
in his earlier works, must be regarded as belonging,
more or less completely, to the school of Rossini.<a name="page_089" id="page_089"></a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.<br /><br />
<small>DONIZETTI AND BELLINI.</small></h2>

<p>D<small>ONIZETTI</small>, Rossini's immediate successor but not supplanter,
composed from sixty to seventy operas ("<i>c'est
beaucoup" dirait</i> Candide) of which to this day three at
least ("<i>c'est beaucoup" dirait</i> Martin), are still played
regularly every season in London: <i>Lucia, Lucrezia</i>, and
<i>La Favorita</i>. Of his two charming works in the light
style&mdash;comic operas in which the composer never approaches
the farcical, never once ceases to be graceful&mdash;neither
<i>L'Elisir</i> nor <i>Don Pasquale</i> can be compared to
the much more vigorous <i>Barber</i>. Nor has Donizetti
produced any work so full of melody as <i>Semiramide</i>, or
so dramatic as <i>William Tell</i>. But he rises to unwonted
heights in the last act of <i>La Favorite</i>; which, composed
for the French Académie, became naturalised in due
time on the Italian operatic stage under the title of
<i>La Favorita</i>.</p>

<p>Although the career of Donizetti was very much
longer than that of Bellini, whom he preceded and whom
he survived, he produced in proportion to the number
of his works fewer by a great deal which have kept
the stage.</p>

<p>Donizetti brought out his first opera <i>Enrico di Borgogna</i>
at Venice in 1818, when he was twenty years of
age, and <i>Catarina Cornaro</i>, his sixty-third (not to count<a name="page_090" id="page_090"></a>
two or three that were never produced) at Naples, in
1844, when he was forty-six.</p>

<p>Bellini brought out the first of his works performed in
public, <i>Bianca e Fernando</i> (he had previously composed
a sort of pasticcio for the school theatre of the Naples
Conservatorio) at the San Carlo in 1826, when he was
twenty-five years of age; and his last, <i>I Puritani</i>, at Paris
in 1835. He had a career then, of but nine years, during
which he composed ten operas, of which five were played
with great success, and of which three, <i>La Sonnambula</i>,
<i>Norma</i>, and <i>I Puritani</i>, forty-five years after their composer's
death, still keep the stage. Stendhal (or perhaps
it was Carpani) had foretold that Rossini, the composer
of florid music, would be followed by a master whose
melodies would be remarkable for extreme simplicity,
and this prophecy was fulfilled in the case of Bellini.</p>

<p>Donizetti, like so many other composers, was not
encouraged by his parents to adopt the career in
which he was destined to obtain so much distinction.
When, however, his father at last consented to his
becoming a professional musician, he is said to have
presented him with an ivory scraper, as if to impress
upon him the necessity of practising the art of erasing.
Probably no composer ever did less in that line than
Donizetti; and though he wrote more accurately than
many other Italian composers, one is frequently astonished
to find in his works melodies of significance and
beauty followed at haphazard by the merest trivialities.
Donizetti never went to work without the paternal
scraper by his side. The fluent composer, however,
had no occasion to make use of it for scratching out<a name="page_091" id="page_091"></a>
notes; and it never seems to have occurred to him to
strike out feeble passages, not to say entire pieces.
What Donizetti's father should have given him was not
a scraper but a pair of scissors.</p>

<p>Donizetti, born at Bergamo in 1798, was but seventeen
years of age when he commenced his studies in his
native town under Mayer, who, before the appearance
of Rossini, was one of the most popular composers in
Italy; and he finished them (so far as studies can ever
be finished) at Bologna under Pilotti and Mattei, the
latter of whom had some years previously been Rossini's
instructor. Finding that Mattei gave him very few
lessons at the Bologna Lyceum, where he was professor,
the youthful and ingenious Donizetti contrived to
obtain supplementary ones by making himself very
agreeable to his master and by turning the conversation
as often as possible to musical subjects. He even went
so far as to play at cards every evening with Mattei's
aged mother, a piece of benevolence for which he was
rewarded by much instructive talk from the grateful
son. While at the Lyceum Donizetti occupied himself
not only with music, but also with drawing, architecture,
and even poetry; and that he could turn out fair
enough verses for musical purposes was shown when,
many years afterwards, he wrote&mdash;so rapidly that the
word "improvised" might here be used&mdash;for the benefit
of a manager in distress, both words and music of a little
one-act opera, called <i>Il Campanello</i>, founded on the
<i>Sonnette de Nuit</i> of Scribe.</p>

<p>No composer, with the exception of Mozart, possessed
<a name="page_092" id="page_092"></a>a more remarkable memory than Donizetti. After two
hearings of Allegri's <i>Miserere</i>, Mozart remembered the
whole work so as to be able to write it out note for
note; and Donizetti, wishing to procure for Mayer a
copy of an opera which was being performed at Bologna,
and which the impresario had refused to lend, had
such a lively recollection of the music after hearing it
two or three times that he was able to put it down
on paper from beginning to end. Unfortunately
the tellers of these stories omit as a rule to say
whether the possessors of such wonderful mnemonic
powers make notes while hearing the compositions,
which, in rather a literal sense, they propose to
carry away with them. A prodigious memory for small
things as for great would be necessary to enable a
musician in the present day to write out, even after
a dozen hearings, an opera by Meyerbeer or by Wagner
with all the changes of harmony, all the details of
instrumentation. The operas, however, of Donizetti's
youth were much simpler affairs than these latter-day
productions.</p>

<p>Already known by many pieces of instrumental and
religious music, Donizetti produced his first opera,
<i>Enrico di Borgogna</i>, at Venice in 1818. This work
obtained so much success that the composer was requested
to undertake at once a second one for the
same city. After writing an opera for Mantua in 1819,
<i>Il Falignamo di Livonia</i>, Donizetti visited Rome, where
his <i>Zoraïde di Granata</i> procured him an exemption from
military service, which would otherwise have carried
him off, and the honour of being crowned at the
Capitol. He now produced a whole series of operas<a name="page_093" id="page_093"></a>
which owed their success chiefly to the skill with
which he imitated the style of Rossini. Strangely
enough it was not until Rossini had ceased to write
that Donizetti, his immediate successor, exhibited something
like a style of his own. In 1830, however, the
in many parts highly-dramatic <i>Anna Bolena</i> was produced;
a work which was long regarded as its composer's
masterpiece. Donizetti wrote <i>Anna Bolena</i>
for Pasta and Rubini, and it was first represented for
Pasta's benefit in the year 1831. In the tenor air,
<i>Vivi tu</i>, Rubini made a striking success; and it was in
this opera, as Henry VIII., that Lablache first gained
the favour of the London public. <i>Anna Bolena</i> was
destined soon to be eclipsed by other works from the
pen of the same composer; and it is now but rarely,
if ever, heard. Many years, indeed, have passed since
it was last performed in London with Mdlle. Titiens in
the principal character. It contains an unusually large
number of expressive, singable melodies; and many of
its scenes possess more dramatic significance than belong
as a rule to Rossini's Italian works. It marks a step
in fact, in the movement from the style of Rossini,
as exhibited in his Italian operas, towards that of
Verdi; a movement in which Bellini, standing by
himself, cannot be said to have had any part.
Neither in his earlier operas does Bellini, like Donizetti,
resemble Rossini, nor in his later ones does he, like
Donizetti, approach what was afterwards to be known
as the style of Verdi.</p>

<p><i>Lucrezia Borgia</i>, written for Milan in 1834, was a
distinct advance on <i>Anna Bolena</i>. This work, with<a name="page_094" id="page_094"></a>
<i>Lucia</i> and <i>La Favorita</i>, by which it was to be succeeded,
must be ranked among Donizetti's most successful
productions; and it has already been pointed out
that the three operas just named are the only ones by
which Donizetti is now represented regularly every
year at our great lyrical theatres. <i>Lucrezia Borgia</i> is based
on one of Victor Hugo's most dramatic plays; but the
composer has not turned to so effective account as might
have been expected, the great scene in which Maffio
Orsini's drinking song is interrupted by the funeral
dirge given to the procession of monks in the outside
street. Like Verdi, some years afterwards, in <i>Ernani</i>
and in <i>Rigoletto</i>, Donizetti counted too much on a
musical effect which is naturally much more impressive
in a spoken drama, where music, until this one scene,
has not been heard, than in an opera which is sung
throughout. Francis I.'s song, in the drama of <i>Le Roi
s'amuse</i>, arrests the attention much more than does the
Duke of Mantua's canzone in <i>Rigoletto</i>. The horn of
Hernani is mysterious and terrifying in the play, while
in the opera, heard after many other horns, not to speak
of cornets, trombones, ophecleides, and all the instruments
of the Sax family, it scarcely excites even a
feeling of surprise. As regards <i>Lucrezia Borgia</i>, though
the singers of the drinking-song and the chanters of
the burial service have the scene entirely to themselves,
yet the contrast between reckless life and inevitable
death is less striking in a work where music possesses
no special significance than in one where music has been
introduced for the sake of impressiveness in the single
scene where it is employed. Taking it, however, for<a name="page_095" id="page_095"></a>
what it is worth, Donizetti's successor, Verdi, would
doubtless have made more of it than Donizetti himself
has done. Maffio Orsini's brindisi is spirited, and
characteristically voluptuous. But there is nothing
very awe-inspiring in the chorus of monks at the back
of the stage; and the two pieces bear no relation to
one another&mdash;which they might perhaps with advantage
have been made to do.</p>

<p><i>Lucrezia Borgia</i> contains less recitative than belongs
to the operas of Rossini, who himself dispensed with the
endless monologues and recitatives cultivated by his
predecessors. Indeed, the amount of measured talk
in <i>Lucrezia Borgia</i> scarcely exceeds that which is to be
met with in the most popular of Verdi's works. The
brilliancy of the introduction, the series of dramatic
scenes&mdash;for which the composer had, above all, to thank
his librettist, who, in his turn, was indebted to Victor
Hugo&mdash;and an unusually large number of tuneful themes
for four leading personages among whom the interest is
judiciously distributed, could not fail to secure for
<i>Lucrezia Borgia</i> the success it in fact obtained.</p>

<p>The graceful <i>Elisir d'Amore</i>, which, owing to the
prevailing taste for spectacular opera, is now but rarely
heard, was given for the first time at Milan in 1832.
Donizetti was now composing operas at the rate of
about three a year. Many of them made but little
impression and scarcely a twelfth part of them are
performed in the present day.</p>

<p>In 1835, however, Donizetti produced an opera
which was received with enthusiasm, which soon
became popular throughout Europe, and which seems<a name="page_096" id="page_096"></a>
to possess as much vitality now as when it was
first brought out. <i>Lucia di Lammermoor</i>, the work
in question, contains some of the most beautiful
melodies, in the sentimental style, that Donizetti
has composed; and it is especially admired by
musicians for the broadly conceived, well-constructed
and highly dramatic finale which brings the second act
to so effective a conclusion. The sudden appearance of
Edgar of Ravenswood just as his devoted but despairing
Lucy has been forced to sign the contract which
gives her to another, is but the first of a series of
situations, skilfully varied and contrasted, which the
librettist has ably planned, and which have been admirably
treated by the composer. The part of Lucia,
beloved by every "light soprano" of the present day,
was written for Persiani; that of Edgardo, which, in the
days of the great tenors, was even more popular than
the prima donna's part, for Duprez. Of the last act of
<i>Lucia</i>, which, until the reign of the light sopranos set in,
used to be considered the crowning glory of the opera,
Donizetti wrote both words and music. It has already
been mentioned that he once transformed a French
vaudeville into an Italian opera or operetta; and it may
be added that the libretti of <i>Betly</i> and of <i>La Figlia del
Reggimento</i> are both from his pen. <i>La Figlia del Reggimento</i>,
however, was only <i>La Fille du Régiment</i> translated
into Italian; and the libretto of <i>Betly</i> is based,
scene by scene, on Adolphe Adam's little opera of <i>Le
Chalet</i>&mdash;known in English as the <i>Swiss Cottage</i>. In
the case of the last act of <i>Lucia</i>, Donizetti not only
wrote the words; he designed the scenes. In the novel<a name="page_097" id="page_097"></a>
Edgar loses himself on the seashore, and is drowned.
In the opera, however, when so far as Lucia is concerned
the story is at an end, he reappears in an appropriate
cemetery to celebrate, in a lyrical lament, the virtues of
his demented love; to be informed by a chorus of
retainers that she has not only lost her reason, but has
departed altogether from this world; and finally to
stab himself while still singing the praises of his "<i>bell'
alma adorata</i>." When the Lucia of the evening is Patti,
Nilsson, or Albani, and the Edgardo is no one in particular,
the final scene of course falls flat; no one,
indeed, stops to hear it. But the case was quite
different when the part of Edgardo was filled by a great
dramatic vocalist, like Duprez, or in later days by Mario.</p>

<p>In 1835 Donizetti visited Paris, and there brought
out his <i>Marino Faliero</i>, remembered for a time by
several pretty pieces, including, in particular, the
opening chorus for the workmen in the arsenal, and a
chorus of gondoliers at the beginning of the second act.
He was more successful when revisiting the French
capital, in 1840, he produced there his opera of <i>I Martiri</i>,
founded on the subject of <i>Polyeucte</i> which, composed for
Naples with a view to Nourrit in the principal part,
had been objected to by the Neapolitan censorship; <i>La
Fille du Régiment</i>, written for and performed at the
Opéra Comique; and <i>La Favorite</i> composed in the first
instance for a house of the second rank, the Théâtre
de la Renaissance, but afterwards transferred to the
Académie. <i>La Favorite</i>&mdash;or <i>La Favorita</i>, as it became
after passing from the French to the Italian stage&mdash;has,
like <i>Lucrezia Borgia</i>, the advantage of being<a name="page_098" id="page_098"></a>
founded on a highly dramatic story. It is based on
a French drama known, until the opera caused it to
be forgotten, as <i>Le Comte de Comminges</i>; and it seems
to owe its origin to a Spanish work. In <i>La Favorita</i>,
as in most Spanish plays, there is no unfolding of
the plot through introductory narrative. The action,
from the beginning, takes place beneath the eyes of
the spectator. A young man, already tired of the
world, is seeking repose in the seclusion of a monastery.
But he has been troubled by a vision. The
vision still haunts him, and the prior vainly exhorts
him in a duet to abandon all thought of the external,
and to concentrate his attention on the inward and
spiritual. Fernando's adventures with the beautiful
lady who turns out to be the "favourite" of the
king, the recompense bestowed upon him in the shape
of this lady's hand for the valour he has shown in
the king's service, and his ultimate return to the monastery
when he finds how bitterly he has been deceived,
need not here be recounted. It is worth observing,
however, that the success of the opera has been in a
great measure due to the excellence of the libretto; and
that in all really good libretti, as in that of <i>La Favorita</i>,
the action of the piece, instead of being related, is
presented continuously on the stage. The duet of the
first act for Fernando and the chief of the monastery
is sufficiently interesting. The choruses of women and
the ballet music (of which these choruses form part),
in the second act, are graceful and melodious; and the
king's air in the third act, <i>Pour tant d'amour</i>, has been
always liked both by the popular baritones who sing<a name="page_099" id="page_099"></a>
it and by the public. Leonora's scena, too, "O mon
Fernand," possesses, at least in the slow movement (the
quick one being quite unworthy of it), a certain amount
of beauty. But the fourth act of <i>La Favorita</i> is worth
all the rest of the opera, and it may well be regarded
as the finest act Donizetti has composed. The calmness
and purity of the tenor's air, "Ange si pur," and the
passionate impulsiveness of the final duet for the despondent
lovers, are eminently dramatic: the character
of each piece being perfectly in accord with the situation.
The choruses are highly impressive, and the whole
scene becomes filled with earnest animation as it moves
towards the final climax. Donizetti is said to have
sketched and in the main to have completed this act at
a single sitting, and in the space of some three or four
hours. The andante, however, of the duet was added
at the rehearsals; and the cavatina, "Ange si pur"
was borrowed from the score of a work never brought
out&mdash;<i>Le Duc d'Albe</i>. If there could be any doubt
about the fact, it would be difficult to believe that
Fernando's air had not been inspired by the situation
in which it occurs. So, after all, in a measure it was;
since the composer took it from elsewhere to introduce
it where he knew it would be in place.</p>

<p><i>La Favorita</i> was by no means Donizetti's last work.
He had yet to write <i>Linda di Chamouni</i>, in which there
is more of what is called "local colour" than in any
other of his operas; and <i>Don Pasquale</i>, which, apart from
the brightness and gaiety of its never-ending series
of melodies, would be remembered if only from the
circumstance of its having been written for that<a name="page_100" id="page_100"></a>
incomparable quartet, Grisi, Mario, Tamburini, and
Lablache. The very year (1843) that Donizetti produced
<i>Don Pasquale</i> at Paris he brought out <i>Maria di
Rohan</i> at Vienna. The music of <i>Maria di Rohan</i> is in
some respects the most dramatic that Donizetti has
written. The libretto, like almost every good libretto,
is based on a French play&mdash;<i>Un Duel sous Richelieu</i>; and
it contains a very strong part for the baritone, in which,
at our Royal Italian Opera, Ronconi has often shown
the highest histrionic genius, together with a certain
inability to sing in tune. <i>Maria di Rohan</i>, however, is
not to be called dramatic simply because it contains
one great dramatic part. What is more important is
the fact that the music of the work is appropriate to the
various personages and to the great situations of the
piece. In portraying the original of the jealous
husband, Donizetti exhibits all the earnestness and
vigour of Verdi, whom, as before observed, he resembles
more in <i>Maria di Rohan</i> than in any of his
earlier works.</p>

<p>Donizetti's last opera was <i>Catarina Cornaro</i>, brought
out at Naples in 1844. This was his sixty-third dramatic
work, without counting a certain number&mdash;variously
estimated, but not likely to be great&mdash;which
have not been represented. At least two-thirds of
Donizetti's operas have never been heard in England.
Soon after the production of <i>Catarina Cornaro</i> Donizetti
fell into a melancholy condition. Symptoms of dementia
manifested themselves while he was on a visit
to Paris. The doctors thought the air of his native
town might have some salutary effect, and the patient<a name="page_101" id="page_101"></a>
was accordingly ordered to Bergamo; but the case was
already a hopeless one. He was taken to Bergamo, but
was attacked with paralysis on the journey; and soon
after his arrival, having experienced a second attack, he
succumbed.</p>

<p>Donizetti, as has already been said, worked for some
time before and for many years after Bellini, whom he
preceded and survived. Bellini was born in 1806, nine
years after Donizetti, and died in 1837, thirteen years
before him. He was a native of Sicily, and his father,
with whom he took his first lessons in music, was an
organist at Catania. The organist was persuaded to send
his son to Naples by a Sicilian nobleman, who promised
to pay his expenses as a student at the famous Conservatorio,
which he in due time entered, and where he had
for fellow-pupil Mercadante&mdash;more or less known whereever
Italian opera has been cultivated by his <i>Giuramento</i>,
the only one of his numerous works which ever met with
anything like an enduring success. Mercadante was a
better musician than Bellini. But he possessed far less
creative power; and his creations or inspirations in
the shape of melodies are seldom comparable in beauty
to those of which the scores of <i>La Sonnambula</i>, <i>Norma</i>,
and <i>I Puritani</i> are so full. The tenor's love-song in <i>Il
Giuramento</i>, and the highly dramatic duet which brings
that opera to a conclusion, will be remembered by all
who have once heard this masterpiece of a composer
who did not produce masterpieces. Opera-goers of the
last thirty years cannot altogether forget him; and it
may in particular be observed that he made a far more
effective use of the orchestra than his more divinely<a name="page_102" id="page_102"></a>
endowed fellow-student, who thought and felt in melody
as Ovid, and afterwards Pope, "lisped in numbers:"
every sequence of notes that occurred to him being
melodious.</p>

<p>Bellini composed his first work while he was studying
at the Conservatorio, where it was afterwards performed.
His next production was intended for the
outside public. It was entitled <i>Adelson e Salvino</i>,
and had the honour, or at least the advantage, of
being represented in the presence of the illustrious
Barbaja, who, without being a musician, was, as we have
already seen, a keen appreciator of musical excellence.
It would have been necessary, perhaps, to have been a
little blind not to perceive the merit of three such masters
as Rossini, Donizetti, and Bellini. Such blindness
however, was as a matter of fact exhibited by a good
many, whereas the ex-waiter of the San Carlo gambling
saloon showed himself clear-sighted in the matter.
Rossini and Donizetti had both been under engagements
to Barbaja, and he was not going to allow Bellini to
escape him. The famous impresario was at this time
director of the San Carlo at Naples, of the Scala at
Milan, of some smaller operatic establishments in Italy,
and of the Italian Opera at Vienna. He commissioned
Bellini in the first place to write an opera for Naples,
where, in 1826, he brought out his <i>Bianca e Fernando</i>.
This work obtained no very great amount of success.
But it pleased a considerable portion of the public; and
it so far satisfied Barbaja that the sagacious manager
entrusted the young composer, now twenty years of age,
with the libretto of <i>Il Pirata</i>, in which the principal<a name="page_103" id="page_103"></a>
part was to be written specially for Rubini. This time
Bellini's opera was to be produced at La Scala. In the
simple touching melodies of <i>Il Pirata</i>&mdash;of which the
principal one for the tenor, quickly laid hold of by
composers for the pianoforte and the violin, was still
remembered long after the opera, as a whole, had been
forgotten&mdash;Bellini at once revealed the character of his
genius; and the composer of twenty was destined to
express the reaction he felt within himself, and which
the public was prepared to feel, against the florid style
of Rossini. While composing <i>Il Pirata</i>, Bellini retired
into the country with the singer on whose execution the
success of the work would so much depend. Rubini
sang the melodies of his part as Bellini wrote them;
and Bellini is said not to have succeeded all at once in
inducing him to abandon his taste for ornamentation,
and in prevailing upon him to deliver the simple phrases
of his principal airs, not only from the chest, but also
from the heart. Rubini and his composer, Bellini and
his singer, soon understood one another; and in his
great scene the admired tenor excited the utmost enthusiasm.
Now were fulfilled the words of the prophet
Stendhal (or perhaps it was the seer Carpani beneath
whose mantle Stendhal, we know, was in the habit of
concealing himself), who, writing only some two or three
years before, had foretold that Rossini would be followed
by a composer remarkable for the simplicity of his style.</p>

<p>After producing in succession <i>La Straniera</i> (Milan,
1828), <i>Zaira</i> (Parma, 1829), Bellini brought out at
Venice his operatic version of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, under
the title of <i>I Capuletti ed i Montecchi</i> which owed such<a name="page_104" id="page_104"></a>
success as it obtained to the singing of Mdle. Pasta, as
<i>Il Pirata</i> had been indebted for the favour with which
it was received to the singing of Rubini. The years
1829, 1830, 1831, and 1832 are especially memorable
in the history of Italian opera; for in the first of
these Rossini's <i>William Tell</i>, in the second Donizetti's
<i>Anna Bolena</i>, in the third Bellini's <i>Sonnambula</i>, and in
the fourth Bellini's <i>Norma</i>, was produced. The
Italian school of operatic music was certainly at that
time supreme in Europe; and Rossini, Donizetti, and
Bellini continued for many years to hold sway at
theatres where they have now to share their dominion
with the composers of France and Germany&mdash;with
Gounod, Ambroise Thomas, and Bizet, with Meyerbeer
and with Wagner.</p>

<p><i>La Sonnambula</i>, as the work of a new composer, was
a good deal sneered at on the occasion of its first production
in London. But its endless flow of melodies&mdash;many
of which, being full of true emotion, are so far
thoroughly dramatic&mdash;could not fail to ensure its
success, with the public at large; and this success,
now of half a century's duration, has scarcely diminished
since the part of <i>Amina</i> was first undertaken by
Pasta, and that of <i>Elvino</i> by Rubini. Our old friend,
Lord Mount-Edgcumbe, true type of the praiser of times
gone by, having been scared by Rossini, was not likely
to be calmed down by Bellini. Of <i>Norma</i> he tells us
that the scene of the opera was laid "in Wales," and
that it "was not liked." It is difficult to understand
the mood of one, having ears to hear, who, whatever he
might think of <i>Norma</i> as a specimen of the highest<a name="page_105" id="page_105"></a>
kind of tragic opera, could fail to "like it." Rossini,
together with a mass of opera-goers in all countries,
was of those who not only "liked" but greatly admired
<i>Norma</i>; and he gave the composer the benefit of his
counsels when the still young Bellini (he was even
now only thirty years of age) undertook to write an
opera for the Italian Theatre of Paris, with Grisi, Rubini,
Tamburini, and Lablache in the principal parts. The
effect of Rossini's advice may be seen in the greater
degree of attention paid by Bellini to the orchestration of
<i>I Puritani</i> and to the concerted music. It would have
been well if some one had recommended Bellini not to
set to work upon so poor a libretto as that of <i>I Puritani</i>
derived from Ancelot's poor novel, <i>Les Puritains d'Ecosse</i>.
Rubini's air, "Ah te, o cara," the polacca for Grisi,
the duet in three movements for Tamburini and
Lablache,&mdash;as to which Rossini, writing an account of
the opera to a friend at Milan, remarked that some
echo of the final outburst for the two voices, with its
brazen accompaniments, must surely have reached him,&mdash;and
the beautiful tenor solo of the closing concerted
piece: these in themselves must have been enough to
secure the success of the opera. The last-named
melody for the tenor voice, so thoroughly religious in
character, was sung at Bellini's funeral to the words of
the <i>Lacrymosa</i>; and it was in the midst of the enthusiasm
created by his last work that Bellini, at the age of
thirty-eight, died.<a name="page_106" id="page_106"></a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br /><br />
<small>VERDI.</small></h2>

<p>G<small>UISEPPE</small> V<small>ERDI</small>, the successor at once of Bellini and
of Donizetti, but whose energetic style bears a far greater
resemblance to that of Donizetti in his later works
(<i>Maria di Rohan</i>, for instance) than to that of Bellini,
was born near Parma, on the 9th of October, 1814. His
father was an innkeeper in a humble way of business,
and Verdi's first lessons in music were taken from
the local organist. In 1833, thanks to the assistance
of a rich patron of art, he went to Milan, where for
three years he studied under Lavigna, musical conductor
at the Scala Theatre. It was not until 1839
that he succeeded in getting his first opera, <i>Oberto,
Conte di San Bonifazio</i>, produced. But the manager
of the Scala, where it was performed was so satisfied
with its success that he gave the young composer an
order for three other works. Unfortunately at this
juncture Verdi lost a wife whom he had recently
married and to whom he was tenderly attached. He
had just undertaken the uncongenial and now hateful
task of composing an <i>opera buffa</i> entitled, <i>Un Giorno di
Regno</i>; and, as might have been expected, this work
was somewhat deficient in comedy. It failed; and so
complete was the fiasco that the director of La Scala felt
himself justified in declining to receive from Verdi the
two other operas which he had agreed to take.<a name="page_107" id="page_107"></a></p>

<p>The unhappy composer had now to begin his career
again; and as the first step he passed a year without
writing a note. He then set to work once more and
composed his well-known opera on the subject of Nebuchadnezzar,
called familiarly <i>Nabuco</i>. <i>Nabucodonosore</i>,
produced in London, where the biblical subject had been
objected to by the censorship, under the title of Nino,
was the first work by which Verdi became famous out
of his own country; and the success of <i>Nabuco</i> became
in due time European. <i>Nabuco</i> (1842) was followed by
<i>I Lombardi</i> (1843), and <i>Ernani</i> (1844); and the three
works by which Verdi established his reputation
in Italy were all given without much delay at Her
Majesty's Theatre. The first production, in fact, of
Verdi's works dates from immediately before the secession
which led to the establishment of the Royal
Italian Opera. An opera on the subject of the <i>Two
Foscari</i> was brought out at Rome in 1844, and some
three or four years afterwards was given at the Royal
Italian Opera, with Ronconi in the principal part.
<i>Ernani</i>, however, at both our rival opera houses was
for some time the most admired and the most often
played of the new composer's works.</p>

<p>At this time Verdi's music met with but little appreciation
from critics, who declared it to be noisy
and commonplace, and who were particularly offended
by so much brass being employed in the orchestration,
and by so many of the choruses being written in unison.
The new composer was accused, moreover, of passing
too abruptly from one piece to another, of not sufficiently
preparing his effects, and so on. We have seen how<a name="page_108" id="page_108"></a>
Rossini was attacked when his operas were first produced
in England; and the Lord Mount-Edgcumbes of
1848, and indeed of many years later, were thoroughly
dissatisfied with Verdi, whom it was the fashion to represent
in the newspapers of the day as a sort of
melodramatic mountebank. Even as late as 1856, when
the richly melodious, and in many respects highly
dramatic <i>Trovatore</i> was given at the Royal Italian Opera,
the talent, or rather the genius of Verdi, was still
systematically denied. The style in which Verdi's
operas were habitually executed in London may have
had something to do with the charges pressed so energetically
against him. Those, however, who have heard
Verdi conduct his own works are aware that though
his scores may contain parts for a considerable number
of brass instruments, yet the brassiness of the orchestra
is kept down and a proper balance of sonority maintained.
Fully informed as to why Verdi's works
ought not to be admired, the public of London persisted
in admiring them; and it may be here mentioned that
for some years Verdi was not much better treated by
the critical press of France than by that of England.
M. Scudo, writing in the <i>Revue des deux Mondes</i>
found in Verdi the same faults already mentioned
as those of which he was habitually accused in
England. <i>Il Trovatore</i>, however, did much towards
converting M. Scudo; and the success of that work, if
not the work itself, did much to shake the faith, or
rather the unfaith, of those English critics and connoisseurs
who had previously disbelieved in Verdi. The
production of <i>Rigoletto</i> at the Royal Italian Opera a<a name="page_109" id="page_109"></a>
year or two later, with Madame Bosio (most charming
of Gildas), Signor Mario, and Signor Ronconi in the
principal parts, made those who were still sceptical as
to Verdi's high merits appear somewhat ridiculous. <i>La
Traviata</i>, with its questionable story derived from the
younger Dumas's novel and play of <i>La Dame aux
Camélias</i>, was a good deal blamed by reason of its
libretto; and also on account of the alleged triviality
of the music, which, however, thanks to the tone of
genuine emotion in many of its strains, still lives, and
is now, indeed, more popular than ever.</p>

<p>Verdi's success in England was confirmed, and more
than confirmed, by the production at the Royal Italian
Opera of <i>Un Ballo in Maschera</i> (founded on the same
subject as Auber's <i>Gustave III.</i>), with an execution
which was above all remarkable for the style in which
the part of the Duke, vaguely described as "Il Duca,"
was played by Signor Mario, and that of Renato, whose
wife the Duke betrays, by Signor Graziani; and for
the last twelve or fifteen years it has been considered
bad taste not to admire Verdi's music. Indeed, since
<i>Aïda</i>, his latest, most serious, most studied, and, in the
true sense of the word, most dramatic opera, it has
become the fashion in some musical circles to place him
above all other Italian composers, to contrast the significance
of his melodies, the characterisation of his
personages, and the forcible construction of his scenes,
with the careless, haphazard stringing together of
meaningless, if singable tunes, and of ingenious rather
than dramatic concerted pieces which mark the style or
want of style of so many Italian composers. It is<a name="page_110" id="page_110"></a>
only fair, however, to remember that Verdi has not yet
surpassed <i>William Tell</i>, that he has produced nothing
superior in the way of concerted finale to the celebrated
one which closes the second act of <i>Lucia</i>, and that
he scarcely could have treated the last act of <i>La Favorita</i>
more dramatically, or with a greater abundance of
melodic ideas than Donizetti&mdash;here by the way, writing
at times very much in Verdi's own manner.</p>

<p>In pursuing the story of Verdi's constantly increasing
success among the English we have departed from the
general history of his career. It must be mentioned,
however, that many of Verdi's operas which gained great
favour in Italy have either never been given in England
at all, or have been performed in this country without
exciting much enthusiasm. Nor was any great impression
made in England by the work which, under the
title of <i>Masnadieri</i>, Verdi wrote expressly for Her
Majesty's Theatre in the days of Jenny Lind, with
Jenny Lind herself, Gardoni, and Lablache in the principal
parts. No one seems to have suggested that
Verdi's <i>King Lear</i> should be performed in England;
but from time to time there has been some talk of
producing his <i>Macbeth</i>, of which a French version
was brought out, not unsuccessfully, at the Théâtre
Lyrique of Paris, with some additional music, and
especially some new ballet scenes by the composer.</p>

<p>It is scarcely worth while to recall Verdi's failures:
but <i>Luisa Miller</i> and <i>La Forza del Destino</i> must in
fairness be reckoned among the number. <i>Luisa
Miller</i> is based on the theme of Schiller's pathetic
but over-dolorous drama <i>Cabale und Liebe</i>. For<a name="page_111" id="page_111"></a>
the basis of <i>La Forza</i> Verdi did not have recourse
to Schiller as in the case of <i>Luisa Miller</i> and <i>I Massdieri</i>,
nor to Victor Hugo as in that of <i>Ernani</i> and of
<i>Rigoletto</i> (<i>Le Roi s'amuse</i>). His librettist borrowed
the subject from a most sanguinary melodrama by a
Spanish author of some distinction, though with such
bloodthirsty tendencies that he brings almost every
character in his play to a violent end, while one of
the leading personages, after apparently meeting his
death, is restored to life to be killed again. In <i>La
Forza del Destino</i> the composer has so neglected the
concerted music that the work does not include one
regularly constructed concerted piece. It contains,
however, some beautiful melodies for the solo voice,
including one in particular assigned to the prima
donna, which Verdi, from having inscribed it beneath
one of his best portraits, would seem to regard as
characteristically his own. Of Verdi's <i>Requiem</i>, composed
in memory of Manzoni, little need be said except
that it is melodious, impressive, and often very dramatic&mdash;dramatic,
however, in the style of <i>Aïda</i> not of the
less thoroughly dramatic, but more stagey works of
Verdi's youth.</p>

<p>Verdi, now (1880) in his sixty-seventh year, has by
no means renounced musical composition; and he is
understood to be actively engaged on a new <i>Othello</i>, of
which Signor Boito, author and composer of <i>Mefistofele</i>,
has furnished the libretto, and which is to be brought
out as soon as completed under the title of <i>Iago</i>.</p>

<p>Unlike other composers, Verdi has played a certain
political part, which, however, seems in a great measure<a name="page_112" id="page_112"></a>
to have been forced upon him. In the days before
Italian unity it was discovered that the letters composing
his name might, in due order, be regarded as
signifying "Vittore Emanuele, Re d'Italia"; so that
"Viva Verdi!" came to be accepted as an aspiration
for a united Italian kingdom with Victor Emanuel
on the throne. When <i>Macbeth</i> was brought out, all
sorts of political allusions were discovered in the
libretto; and nothing would satisfy the electors of
Verdi's native town but to make him a member of
the National Assembly of Parma. After the formation
of the Italian kingdom Verdi became a member
of the Italian parliament; and in 1874 the king made
him a senator.<a name="page_113" id="page_113"></a></p>

produced from scanned images of public domain material
from the Internet Archive.)


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
